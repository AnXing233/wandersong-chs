6236	objAngel	{angel}Messenger of the goddess Eya	
6237	objAngel	Forever ago,| her song of creation set your universe into motion

7821	objMask	Hey now, wanderer	
7822	objMask	How were your dreams last night?	
7823	objBard	|I...| don't remember!	
7825	objMask	They can be so easy to lose,| can't they...	
7826	objMask	Well,| no worries.	
7827	objMask	It's a beautiful morning...	
7829	objMask	The birds are singing...	
7830	objMask	What about you?	
7839	objMask	Going to see the ghosts?	
7840	objBard	...Ghosts?	
7841	objMask	A crowd of spirits took over town	
7842	objMask	Everyone's freaking out...|| It's pretty funny	
7843	objMask	Well,| see ya around	
7844	objMask	Wanderer,| if your mind is open...	
7845	objMask	I can teach you about a secret power	
7846	objMask_meet	Called ||DANCE.	
7847	objBard	No thanks!	
7848	objBard	Teach me!	
7849	objMask	I understand.	
7850	objMask	It's a deep hole to delve into.	
7851	objMask	You gotta dig in only when you're ready.	
7852	objMask	Hmmm...	
7853	objMask	I don't know how to put this...	
7854	objMask	But| it looks like...	
7855	objMask	You've|| blocked your pathway to |DANCE.	
7856	objMask	In your mind,| there's a special place...	
7857	objMask	Called the "Controls Menu."	
7858	objMask	I think you've gotta pay that place a visit.	
7859	objMask	Alright.	
7860	objMask	I want you to close your eyes,	
7861	objMask	And picture something called a...	
7862	objMask	DUALSHOCK^4 wireless controller	
7863	objMask	And picture something called|| a "{data_controllername}"	
7864	objMask	...Do you see it?	
7865	objMask	Using that,	
7866	objMask	You gotta hold something called the {data_dancebutton}" to |DANCE.	
7867	objMask	On that "{data_controllername}"...	
7868	objMask	You gotta hold something called the {data_dancebutton} button" to |DANCE.	
7869	objMask	Push that button,| wanderer.	
7870	objMask	I want you to close your eyes,	
7871	objMask	And picture something called|| a "Keyboard"	
7872	objMask	...Do you see it?	
7873	objMask	On that "Keyboard"...	
7874	objMask	You gotta hold something called the "{data_dancebutton} key" to |DANCE.	
7875	objMask	Hold that key down,| wanderer.	
7876	objMask	And feel the dance flow through you...	
7877	objMask	Anytime,| anywhere.	
7878	objMask	With all these ghosts around...	
7879	objMask	I'm really feelin the |spookvibes.	
7880	objMask	Think I might go hang out in a graveyard.	
7881	objMask	|If you come find me there...	
7882	objMask	Then...	
7883	objMask	Somethin special is sure to happen.	
			
7901	objMask	Well hey now, wanderer...	
7902	objMask	Do you know this place?	
7903	objMask	It's called the Tree of Slumber.	
7904	objMask	A pretty magic little spot...	
7905	objMask	Just being around here| m|a|k|e|s|| m|e|||...	
7906	objMask	{wiggle}{shake}{speed .2}yawn{/shake}	
7907	objMask	{wiggle}{shake}{speed .2}yawn{/shake}	
			
7522	objMask	Hey now,| wanderer.	
7523	objMask	I love candy...	
7524	objMask	But I came because of the sick tune they have playing...	
7525	objMask	You wrote it,| didn't you?	
7526	objMask	This is the graveyard...|| spooky,| huh?	
7527	objMask	I love soaking in the spookvibes...	
7528	objMask	...	
7529	objMask	You did good, finding me here...	
7530	objMask	I have something to show you.	
7531	objMask	I know| you know| all about music.	
7532	objMask	But how much do you know...	
7533	objMask	About...||{shake} DANCE?{/shake}	
7534	objMask	I wanna teach you some moves.	
7535	objMask	Wait,| no...	
7536	objMask	I wanna unlock the moves|| that are already waiting inside you...	
7537	objMask	Cause you got a dancing spirit,| wanderer.	
7538	objMask	I'll just help you find it.	
7539	objMask	I was waiting for you...	
7540	objMask	To usher you...|| into the next level of |DANCE.	
7541	objMask	That's right...	
7542	objMask	It's time| to discover a new move.	
7543	objMask	You already know this one,| wanderer.	
7544	objMask	I'm just gonna help you find it.	
7545	objMask	I feel something...	
7546	objMask	Lurking within you...|| just beneath the surface.	
7547	objMask	It's another |DANCE,| wanderer.	
7548	objMask	I think it's time to wake it up.	
7549	objMask	Do you feel it?	
7550	objMask	This place...|| it's got this vibe goin' on.	
7551	objMask	It's trying to tell us something...	
7552	objMask	It's telling us...|| it's time to |DANCE.	
7553	objMask	Relax,| wanderer. |Let the dance in.	
7554	objMask	We've dug deep into DANCE together now.	
7555	objMask	And with each layer deeper we go...	
7556	objMask	We learn about ourselves,| too.	
7557	objMask	Cause |DANCE| comes from deep inside us...	
7558	objMask	And when we let it out,| we're letting our deeper selves out too.	
7559	objMask	So what do you say,| wanderer?	
7560	objMask	Let's let out a new one.	
7561	objMask	I'm here...	
7562	objMask	Feeling all the DANCE around me...	
7563	objMask	Channeling it...	
7564	objMask	And letting it wake up the DANCE that's inside me.	
7565	objMask	I know you feel it too,| wanderer.	
7566	objMask	The power| of the DANCE.	
7567	objMask	Let's reach inside ourselves,	
7568	objMask	And see what gifts we find...	
7569	objMask	I can feel it.	
7570	objMask	Your soul...	
7571	objMask	Your |DANCE| power...	
7572	objMask	It's been growing all along,| wanderer.	
7573	objMask	You've dug deep,| and found the dances sleeping within.	
7574	objMask	I'm proud to have sheparded you on that journey.	
7575	objMask	Now,| one last time.	
7576	objMask	Let's dig deep.	
7577	objMask	All the way to the bottom.	
7578	objMask	For one	
7579	objMask	{shake}FINAL{/shake}	
7580	objMask	dance	
			
7581	objMask	Beautiful dance,| wanderer.	
7582	objMask	...	
7583	objMask	You've come so far...	
7584	objMask	On this journey into |DANCE.	
7585	objMask	I don't have more to show you.	
7586	objMask	From here on,| you've got to keep digging on your own.	
7587	objMask	But don't stop digging,| wanderer.	
7588	objMask	Don't forget|| about DANCE.	
7589	objMask	When you dig deep...	
7590	objMask	The gifts you find are really something special.	
7591	objMask	But this is only the beginning...	
7592	objMask	Of your journey| into DANCE.	
7593	objMask	I hope we'll meet again,	
7594	objMask	In a place where DANCE calls out to us.	
7595	objMask_meet	Do you want me to explain how to dance?	
7596	objBard	No thanks.	
7597	objBard	Yes!	
7598	objMask	Carry it with you on your journey.	
7599	objMask	Show the world| the dance that lives inside you...	
7600	objMask_meet	I can explain how to dance,| if you want.	
7601	objBard	That's o|kay.	
7602	objBard	Please do!	
			
7603	objMask	Hmmm...	
7604	objMask	I don't know how to put this...	
7605	objMask	But| it looks like...	
7606	objMask	You've|| blocked your pathway to |DANCE.	
7607	objMask	In your mind,| there's a special place...	
7608	objMask	Called the "Controls Menu."	
7609	objMask	I think you've gotta pay that place a visit.	
			
7610	objMask	Alright.	
7611	objMask	I want you to close your eyes,	
7612	objMask	And picture something called a...	
7613	objMask	DUALSHOCK^4 wireless controller	
7614	objMask	And picture something called|| a "Controller"	
7615	objMask	{/font}...Do you see it?	
7616	objMask	Using that,	
7617	objMask	{/font}You gotta hold something called the "{data_dancebutton}" to |DANCE.	
7618	objMask	On that "Controller"...	
7619	objMask	You gotta hold something called the "{data_dancebutton} button" to |DANCE.	
7620	objMask	Then,| while you're dancin',	
7621	objMask	Use "{data_triggerbuttons}" to change your dance.	
7622	objMask	I want you to close your eyes,	
7623	objMask	And picture something called|| a "Keyboard"	
7624	objMask	...Do you see it?	
7625	objMask	On that "Keyboard"...	
7626	objMask	You gotta hold something called the "{data_dancebutton} key" to |DANCE.	
7627	objMask	Then,| while you're dancin',	
7628	objMask	Use E,| R,| X| or C|| to change your dance.	
7629	objMask	You can sing at the same time too.	
7630	objMask	And some dances you can do even while movin' around.	
7631	objMask	Don't be afraid to express yourself,| wanderer.	
			
7632	objMask	Alright.	
7633	objMask	That knowledge already lives inside you,| too.	
			
7886	objMask	Hey now,| wanderer	
7887	objMask	Funny seein you here	
7888	objBard	Oh!...|| Hey!	
7889	objMask	Gettin ready to sing a show here in town?	
7890	objBard	I,|| uh,||| maybe?	
7891	objMask	That's cool.	
7892	objMask	Lookin forward to seein it.	
7893	objMask	Mmm...	
7894	objMask	I'm craving candy,| wanderer.	
7895	objMask	Sometimes,| doin' a nice lil thing for yourself...	
7896	objMask	It's the most empowering thing you can do.	
7897	objMask	Wonder if there's any sweets in this town.	
7898	objMask	I'll just keep goin where the wind takes me...	
7899	objMask	It feels good,| flyin high and free.	
7900	objMask	I wonder where I'll be next.	
			
7808	objMask	Hey hey hey now,| wanderer.	
7809	objMask	Sweet moves.	
			
7810	objMask_meet	Didja wanna go back up?	
7811	objBard	Nah.	
7812	objBard	Heck yeah!	
7813	objMask	Cool.	
7814	objMask	I've been wanderin' this ocean.	
7815	objMask	It feels beautiful to get lost...	
7816	objMask	I like not knowing where I am.	
7817	objMask	But there's one island in particular...	
7818	objMask	Well...| maybe I won't say too much about it.	
7819	objMask	Some things are best discovered yourself.	
7820	objMask	Cool.	
			
7798	objMask	I've been wanderin' this ocean.	
7799	objMask	And there's this one island I've found...	
7800	objMask	It feels beautiful to get lost...	
7801	objMask	I like not knowing where I am.	
7804	objMask	But there's one island in particular...	
7805	objMask	Well...| maybe I won't say too much about it.	
7806	objMask	Some things are best discovered yourself.	
7807	objMask	Anyway...	
			
7763	objMask	Well hey now, wanderer	
7764	objMask	It's been some time...	
7765	objBard	What are you doing here?	
7766	objMask	...|||Hmm...	
7767	objMask	|I don't know...	
7770	objMask	Times are tough here...	
7771	objMask	You can feel the sadness in the air.	
7772	objMask	But me...| I'm just chillin.	
7773	objMask	|||Heh...|||#do you get it?	
7774	objMask	Chillin?	
7775	objMask	...|it's because it's cold.	
7776	objMask	You must be really down,| wanderer	
7777	objBard	Yeah,| that's pretty funny.	
7778	objMask	Time's wild, isn't it?	
7779	objMask	Sometimes it speeds right by...	
7780	objMask	Sometimes it drags forever.	
7781	objMask	They say time isn't even real,| you know?	
7782	objMask	But it's hard not to feel anxious when you see the clock ticking down.	
7783	objMask	It feels like our paths are destined to be crossed...	
7784	objMask	Hope you find some inner peace,| whenever we next meet	
7785	objMask	Maybe I'll catch you again later down the road.	
7786	objMask	I think it's invigorating to move around early in the day.	
7787	objMask	What do you think,| wanderer?	
7788	objMask	I know a special place,| in the forest past the telescope...	
7789	objMask	And if you're there right when the sun rises at 7 AM...	
7790	objMask	Well...|| maybe I won't say.	
7791	objMask	You should discover it for yourself.	
			
7792	objBard	Hey...	
7793	objBard	{wiggle}You{/wiggle}| don't have a job...	
7794	objBard	Do you wanna help overthrow the factory?	
7795	objMask	Nah	
7796	objMask	That isn't my pace	
7797	objMask	But thanks for thinkin of me,| heh...	
			
7739	objMask	Oh hey now,| wanderer.	
7740	objBard	You again!	
7741	objBard	What are you doing here?	
7742	objMask	Me?|| I'm catching some sun...	
7743	objMask	Sun's good for you,| wanderer.	
7744	objMask	It's so warm...	
7745	objMask	Just feels |right,| y'know?	
7746	objMask	There are a million billion billion suns like ours.	
7747	objMask	But ours is special to us,| cause it gave us life.	
7748	objMask	And it gives more every day.	
7749	objMask	Just gives and gives and gives...	
7750	objMask	We're so lucky to have that.	
7751	objMask	We humans aren't like the sun.	
7752	objMask	Sometimes we give,| and sometimes we have to take,| too.	
7755	objMask	When we feel lost,| or sad...	
7756	objMask	I think the sun's there to remind us that it ain't all bad.	
7757	objMask	And it is always there,| reminding us.	
7758	objMask	Even when we can't see it behind the clouds.	
7759	objMask	I found a great place to catch the sun...	
7760	objMask	A high up spot in the desert,| far from here...	
7761	objMask	If you find it...|| well,| I better not say.	
7762	objMask	It's for you to discover.	
			
7712	objMask	Whoa...|| hey now,| wanderer.	
7713	objMask	Didn't expect to see you here.	
7714	objBard	Uh...	
7715	objMask	There's really no place like Mohabumi,| is there?	
7716	objMask	It's full of secrets...	
7717	objMask	I think that's important,| wanderer.	
7718	objMask	The world needs mysteries.	
7719	objBard	How|| did you get here??	
7720	objMask	The real truth is...	
7721	objMask	We can never know the real truth.	
7722	objMask	Some questions are just too big.	
7723	objMask	And sometimes the question is more important than the answer.	
7724	objMask	Don't you think?	
7725	objMask	A real mystery can remind us of that.	
7726	objMask	Even a mundane one.	
7727	objMask	Don't seek answers,| wanderer.	
7728	objMask	Answers aren't worth a thing.	
7729	objMask	Answers change all the time.	
7730	objMask	What's true today may not be true tomorrow.	
7731	objMask	And sometimes,	
7732	objMask	What you feel's more important than what you know.	
7733	objMask	You gotta seek...| questions.	
7734	objMask	Mohabumi's got lots of cool nooks.	
7735	objMask	Even some that aren't on the map.	
7736	objMask	I found one particularly special little nook...	
7737	objMask	And if you find it...|| well,| I won't say.	
7738	objMask	Some things are best to discover on your own.	
			
7666	objMask	Hey now,| wanderer.	
7667	objMask	You gonna climb this mountain?	
7668	objMask	I like chilling with these monks...	
7669	objMask	But...|| I might try climbing,| too.	
7670	objMask	Maybe I'll see ya up there.	
7671	objMask	Seems things just get worse and worse these days.	
7672	objMask	Are you scared about the world ending?	
7673	objBard	|||Yeah...	
7674	objMask	To tell the truth,| I am too...	
7675	objMask	It's hard not to be scared.	
7676	objMask	Especially for the things you can't control.	
7677	objMask	Well...|| if you can't control it...	
7678	objMask	There's no point to be scared,| is there?	
7679	objMask	But the scary thing is,	
7680	objMask	What if you can control it,| and you aren't?	
7681	objMask	I really think we're connected,| wanderer.	
7682	objMask	Everywhere I go,| you're there too.	
7683	objMask	That's not nothing.	
7684	objMask	You ever notice how sometimes,	
7685	objMask	An idea will come to many people around the same time?	
7687	objMask	Have you ever felt that when someone shares their thoughts?	
7688	objMask	Like,| "Oh,| I was just thinking about that too!"	
7689	objMask	It's like that,| wanderer.	
7690	objMask	We're all connected by threads visible and invisible.	
7691	objMask	And I think the whole world is thinking together,	
7692	objMask	Even when we don't know it.	
7693	objMask	I don't believe in coincidences.	
7698	objMask	All the big things in the universe...	
7699	objMask	They're just made of small things put together.	
7700	objMask	And those small things are made of even smaller things.	
7701	objMask	It's impossible to understand everything...	
7702	objMask	But to understand something big,	
7703	objMask	You gotta understand the small things it's made of.	
7704	objMask	The crazy thing is...	
7705	objMask	The whole universe is just one big thing.	
7706	objMask	It's made of all the small things together.	
7707	objMask	And that's why...	
7708	objMask	Even the tiniest,| smallest thing,	
7710	objMask	Like the feeling when you tell someone "I love you,"	
7711	objMask	Can tell you something big about the whole universe.	
			
7634	objMask	Hey now,| wanderer...	
7635	objMask	I'm not surprised to see you here.	
7636	objMask	We've been all over the world together now.	
7637	objMask	It's been a huge adventure for me.	
7638	objMask	I bet it has for you too.	
7639	objMask	But someday the adventure's gotta end,| doesn't it...	
7640	objMask	Everything's gotta end| someday.	
7641	objMask	I'm glad to share our connection,| wanderer.	
7642	objMask	We only crossed paths briefly,	
7643	objMask	Here and there...	
7644	objMask	But I think it made a difference.	
7645	objMask	It's amazing,| isn't it?	
7646	objMask	Even the tiny little things we do,	
7647	objMask	They can send out ripples...	
7648	objMask	That change all the people around us...	
7649	objMask	And then all the people around them,	
7650	objMask	And then the whole world.	
7651	objMask	We just gotta make our ripples good.	
7652	objMask	And the whole world would be a bit more good too.	
7653	objMask	When I left on my journey,	
7654	objMask	I thought nothing really mattered.	
7655	objMask	And then,| I started to think,	
7656	objMask	That maybe|| everything does.	
7657	objMask	Now,| I really can't decide which it is.	
7661	objMask	But I know one of those is.	
7662	objMask	And they're almost the same thing...	
7663	objMask	But they're also really not at all.	
7664	objMask	I guess, figuring that out...	
7665	objMask	Is really the biggest question there is.	
			
9432	objMiriam	{shake}SIGH.{/shake}	
9433	objMiriam	Are| {wiggle}you{/wiggle}| from around here?	
9434	objBard	Yeah!

9436	objBard	What?	
9437	objMiriam	{shake}Useless{/shake}	
9438	objMiriam	I swear to Eya,| this whole town...

9440	objMiriam	I don't have time to talk to you.|| The world is ending!!!	
9441	objBard	!	
9442	objBard	That sounds| familiar...	
9443	objBard	Is the world really ending??	
9445	objMiriam	Tuh	
9446	objMiriam	Yes?	
9447	objMiriam	But don't you worry

477	objAnanya	I'm so embarrased...	
478	objAnanya	Wait...	
479	objAnanya	That's exactly what a hallucination |{wiggle}would{/wiggle}| say...	
480	objAnanya	Tell me a story,| sweet little hallucination...	
481	objBard	I'm real!	
482	objBard	But ok!	
483	objBard	Once,| there was...|| a happy unicorn!	
484	objAnanya	Mmm.	
485	objBard	Except,| the happy unicorn WASN'T happy,| because...	
486	objBard	Um...	
487	objBard	She lost her horn!	
488	objAnanya	Mmm oh no...	
489	objBard	Yeah,| so she just looked like a normal horse.	
490	objBard	But in her heart| she knew she was a unicorn!	
491	objBard	And her name was,	
492	objBard	Hmm,	
493	objBard	Miriam!	
494	objAnanya	{size .6}Thaaa|t'ssocoo|fftudfdkjgmls	
495	objBard	{}So Miriam the unicorn,| she went looking for her horn...	
496	objAnanya	{size .3}touhjfhacmgnjganfadhfd......	
497	objBard	{}And...	
498	objBard	...

501	objAnne	Heya!| Welcome to Anne's bomb shop!	
502	objAnne	You want bombs?	
503	objAnne	Cause that's...|| pretty much what I got!	
504	objAnne	Goin' off to find the mermaids,| huh?	
505	objAnne	Why not bring some bombs along with ya?	
			
506	objBard	Why would I want|| {wiggle}bombs?{/wiggle}	
507	objAnne	Y'know.|| To {shake .5}blow stuff up!{}	
508	objAnne	It's fun!	
509	objBard	I'll pass!	
510	objAnne	Say you're out in the world...	
511	objAnne	And ya see a big, suspicious looking crack in a wall.	
512	objAnne	You'll wish you had bombs then!	
513	objAnne	Cracks |always| mean| {shake}treasure!{}	
514	objBard	That's a weird reason to carry bombs around all the time!	
515	objAnne	Sheesh,| what kinda adventure you on anyway?	
516	objBard	A cool one!	
517	objBard	With pirates,| and singing,| and other stuff too!	
518	objAnne	But no bombs?|| Snore.	
			
552	objAstronomer	Hi, sorry...	
553	objAstronomer	I can't talk right now...	
554	objAstronomer	I'm...	
555	objAstronomer	{shake .5}{wiggle}s|t|a|r|v||ing...	
556	objAstronomer	I must be at the diner right away...	
557	objAstronomer	...	
558	objAstronomer	Please excuse me...	
559	objAstronomer	I'm going to the diner|| right now...	
			
560	objAstronomer	Hi, sorry...	
561	objAstronomer	I can't talk right now...	
562	objAstronomer	I need...	
563	objAstronomer	To get back to my research...	
564	objAstronomer	But,| if you want to talk,	
565	objAstronomer	Find me in the diner between midnight and 5AM.	
566	objAstronomer	...	
568	objAstronomer	I have important research to conduct now.	
569	objAstronomer	Find me in the diner after midnight.	
			
612	objAstronomer	Hello.	
613	objAstronomer	I haven't seen you around town before...	
614	objAstronomer	Allow me to introduce myself.	
615	objAstronomer	I'm Elara||, the astronomer.	
616	objAstronomer	I've been observing some interesting celestial activity...	
617	objAstronomer	The stars...	
618	objAstronomer	One by one,| they're...||| going out.	
619	objAstronomer	Unfortunately,| with the factory's smog output,	
620	objAstronomer	I can't see {shake .4}flapping whizzbats{/shake} in the sky anymore.	
621	objAstronomer	Pardon my language.	
622	objAstronomer	So,| I can't continue my research on that phenomenon.	
623	objAstronomer	Instead I've taken to watching the town.	
624	objAstronomer	Plotting...||| subterfuge.	
625	objAstronomer	I can see you don't have much to say,|| so I'll just keep talking.	
626	objAstronomer	I've figured out how one could shut down the factory.	
627	objAstronomer	I just need a cohort.	
628	objBard	I'll do it.	
629	objBard	A co|hort?	
630	objAstronomer	Uhm...|| an accomplice.	
631	objBard	I'll do it.	
632	objBard	Why an a|ccom|plice?	
634	objAstronomer	I can explain if you're interested in doing it.	
635	objBard	I'll do it.	
636	objBard	Why should I?	
637	objAstronomer	Hmmm.	
638	objAstronomer	Maybe you shouldn't.|| It could be dangerous.	
639	objBard	I'll do it.	
640	objBard	Sounds like a bad i|de|a.	
641	objAstronomer	I'm acting in the best interest of the town.	
642	objAstronomer	Danger is sometimes an unfortunate necessity.	
643	objBard	I'll do it.	
644	objBard	How dan|ger|ous?	
645	objAstronomer	OK,|| not really very dangerous.	
646	objAstronomer	I was trying to make it sound exciting.	
647	objBard	I'll do it.	
648	objBard	Oh?	
649	objAstronomer	All we really need are some people on the inside.	
650	objBard	I'll do it.	
651	objBard	Like sec|ret a|gents???	
652	objAstronomer	Yes,| just like that.	
653	objBard	I'll do it.	
654	objBard	Sec|ret a|gents are ex|ci|ting!	
655	objAstronomer	Hmm.|| I suppose they are.	
656	objBard	I'll do it.	
657	objBard	But where do we find them?	
658	objAstronomer	Well,| that's the thing.	
659	objAstronomer	I need someone to help me find them.	
660	objBard	I'll do it.	
661	objBard	How do you find se|cret a|gents?	
662	objAstronomer	We'd need to focus our search on certain individuals.	
663	objBard	I'll do it.	
664	objBard	Like who?	
665	objAstronomer	I.|e,|| people who are awake during the day, but unemployed.	
666	objBard	I'll do it.	
667	objBard	Per|fect re|cruits...	
668	objAstronomer	Yes,| exactly.|| I think 3 additional people from town would suffice.	
669	objAstronomer	We could have a nightly meeting in this diner.	
670	objAstronomer	And together,| we could overthrow the factory.	
671	objBard	I'll do it.	
672	objBard	Good luck find|ing some|one.	
673	objAstronomer	Excellent.	
674	objAstronomer	We'll find the people we need among those in this town.	
675	objAstronomer	Excellent.	
676	objAstronomer	Well,| you know what to do.	
677	objAstronomer	Whoah.	
678	objAstronomer	Seems reverse psychology works,| after all.	
679	objAstronomer	I'm impressed.	
680	objAstronomer	Nobody's taken me up on this yet.	
681	objAstronomer	We need people on the inside to help us.	
682	objAstronomer	We'll have to recruit them from the people of this town.	
683	objAstronomer	Specifically,|| people who are awake during the day, but unemployed.	
684	objAstronomer	I need your help to find them since I live nocturnally.	
685	objAstronomer	If we gather 3 such people,| we could infiltrate the factory...	
686	objAstronomer	And use this diner as a nightly meeting spot.	
687	objAstronomer	Good luck.	
688	objAstronomer	Thank you.	
			
689	objAstronomer	The factory must be taken down.	
690	objAstronomer	For the good of everyone.	
691	objAstronomer	Just require three more recruits...	
692	objAstronomer	Just require two more recruits...	
693	objAstronomer	Just require one more recruit...	
694	objAstronomer	I may be able to provide some intelligence on who to look for.	
695	objAstronomer	If you like.	
696	objAstronomer	There's a man who is constantly crying around the town during the day.	
697	objAstronomer	He seems to have no direction in life...	
698	objAstronomer	So,| he would probably be willing to help us.	
699	objAstronomer	Find out what he wants...	
700	objAstronomer	Have you seen the man who used to always cry around town?	
701	objAstronomer	He has a dog now...	
702	objAstronomer	He seems| emotionally susceptible...	
703	objAstronomer	Seek him out.	
704	objAstronomer	There's a girl standing in the field outside town.	
705	objAstronomer	I pass her every night on my way to and from here.	
706	objAstronomer	I don't believe she's from here...	
707	objAstronomer	But,| maybe she could be an ally.	
708	objAstronomer	There's a sad man who plays music from a rooftop at all hours.	
709	objAstronomer	Since he's so sad and hopeless,	
710	objAstronomer	He almost certainly could be convinced to help us.	
711	objAstronomer	To be honest, I'm not sure who else in this city may be swayed.	
712	objAstronomer	Do you know anybody who has no job?	
713	objAstronomer	The factory used to just be a small toy shop.	
714	objAstronomer	But it grew under the hand of is vicious owner, the Baron...	
715	objAstronomer	Its growth changed the landscape of this place radically.	
716	objAstronomer	If the stars really are dying...| what could it mean?	
717	objAstronomer	I||| {shake .3}need{}| to research this more...	
718	objAstronomer	The factory must be taken down.	
719	objAstronomer	For the good of everyone.	
720	objAstronomer	Just need 3 recruits...	
			
721	objAstronomer	Aha!| You've done it.	
722	objAstronomer	We have a suitable number of recruits for our subterfuge.	
723	objBalalaika	Yes!|| Soon,| the factory will fall...	
724	objBalalaika	And this city shall be free from the shackles of industry!	
725	objWhiner	Yeah!!| Ha ha...	
727	objAstronomer	{wiggle}So...{/wiggle}	
728	objAstronomer	All we need to do now,| is...	
729	objAstronomer	Take up jobs in the factory.	
732	objAstronomer	We have to destroy it.|| From within.	
733	objAstronomer	Or at least,| disrupt its basic order.	
734	objAstronomer	If we take up positions on the factory floor...	
735	objAstronomer	We can work together to do that.	
736	objWhiner	{size .8}I'm excited	
737	objBalalaika	{}It will be the dawn of a glorious new day...	
738	objBalalaika	Comrades!|| Let's join together!	
739	objBalalaika	And lead this city into the light of a factory-free world!	
740	objWhiner	Yeah!!| Ha| ha...	
741	objAstronomer	That may be going a bit far.	
742	objAstronomer	But,|| I appreciate the enthusiasm.	
743	objAstronomer	All the pieces are gathered.	
744	objAstronomer	The plan is ready to go into motion.	
745	objAstronomer	Tomorrow...|| enter the factory...	
746	objAstronomer	I'm beyond eager to resume my research.	
747	objAstronomer	The stars' vanishing...	
748	objAstronomer	What could it mean...?	
			
570	objAstronomer	I've finally been able to observe the sky again...	
571	objAstronomer	And it's as I feared.	
572	objAstronomer	The stars are disappearing.	
573	objAstronomer	But I can't find| a reason...	
574	objBard	Well.| The universe |{wiggle}is{/wiggle}| ending!	
575	objAstronomer	...	
576	objAstronomer	I suppose that is one possible explanation...	
577	objAstronomer	...	
578	objAstronomer	But I don't like that one...	
579	objAstronomer	When you say the universe is ending...	
580	objAstronomer	I mean...|| what makes you say that?	
581	objBard	Because it is!	
582	objBard	I met an angel in my dreams who told me all about it	
583	objBard	And I've been visiting the spirit world	
584	objBard	Meeting magical animal creatures, teaching me a song	
585	objBard	So I can save the world!	
586	objAstronomer	This is all sounding| highly unscientific.	
587	objBard	You don't believe me about the universe ending?	
588	objAstronomer	||Nah.| I believe you.	
589	objAstronomer	As a scientist it's my job to question everything.	
590	objAstronomer	But also,| screw that.	
591	objAstronomer	How does one enter the spirit world?	
592	objBard	I have to sing a special song in a special place!	
593	objAstronomer	Hm.	
594	objAstronomer	A coded sequence of vibrations...	
595	objAstronomer	Perhaps linking our dimension to the vibrations of another	
596	objAstronomer	Creating a brief bridge between worlds...	
597	objAstronomer	||Hm.	
598	objBard	Nope,| pretty sure it's just special and magic!	
599	objAstronomer	Hmmmmmmmm.	
600	objAstronomer	Well.| Good luck on your spirit journey.	
601	objAstronomer	I'll keep observing what I can here.	
602	objAstronomer	Perhaps I'll find something useful to saving us.	
603	objAstronomer	Even in the eye of science,	
604	objAstronomer	We see that all things are connected.	
605	objAstronomer	Particles colliding with particles, effects rippling into infinity...	
606	objAstronomer	All that we observe follows naturally from all that came before.	
607	objAstronomer	When you help others, and create happiness...	
608	objAstronomer	That positivity ripples out, too.	
609	objAstronomer	And makes an objectively better world.	
610	objAstronomer	So keep singing.	
611	objAstronomer	It's good.	
			
519	objAstronomer	Ah,| my old cohort.	
520	objAstronomer	How do you do?	
521	objAstronomer	With the Baron stepping down from the factory...	
522	objAstronomer	I've seized the means of toy production.	
523	objAstronomer	And repurposed it to be my new laboratory.	
524	objAstronomer	There is so much machinery in here with so much potential...	
525	objAstronomer	We could use it to manufacture new technologies.	
526	objAstronomer	To the benefit of everyone.	
527	objAstronomer	That's my vision for this place.	
528	objAstronomer	One by one,|| all the stars went out...	
529	objAstronomer	Until none were left.	
530	objAstronomer	I was watching the sky at that moment.	
531	objAstronomer	It sent a shiver down my spine...	
532	objAstronomer	I was sure the world had come to an end.	
533	objAstronomer	But then,| all at once...	
534	objAstronomer	The sky was filled with completely new stars.	
535	objAstronomer	New constellations,| new galaxies...	
536	objAstronomer	A new hope for us.	
537	objAstronomer	I don't know how long our lease on existence has extended.	
538	objAstronomer	But it made me reconsider what I was doing with mine.	
539	objAstronomer	That's what brought me to here.	
540	objAstronomer	They say the stars guide our destinies.	
541	objAstronomer	That some can be born under a lucky star...	
542	objAstronomer	And some not.	
543	objAstronomer	I think it's a load of sharkquack...	
544	objAstronomer	{size .7}(Pardon my language)	
545	objAstronomer	{size 1}But there's something poetic about a new sky of stars,| isn't there?	
546	objAstronomer	The old stars that guided us are dead...	
547	objAstronomer	And now our destinies are in our own hands.	
548	objAstronomer	We get to decide what will become of this world moving forward.	
549	objAstronomer	Maybe that was always true...	
550	objAstronomer	But now I believe it.	
551	objAstronomer	I hope to create a good future.	
			
754	objMiriam	This time...	
755	objMiriam	I'm gonna stand right here next to you.	
756	objMiriam	Hitch a ride into the spirit world.	
757	objBard	You're coming with me?	
758	objMiriam	Yes!	
759	objBard	...	
760	objBard	Um...| but,| aren't you...	
761	objBard	I mean...|| aren't you gonna miss...	
762	objBard	The sad roof guy?	
763	objBard	Who liked you?	
764	objMiriam	No.	
765	objMiriam	What's it usually like in there,| anyway?	
766	objMiriam	The one time I went was after Queen Chaos died.	
767	objMiriam	So it was all...| dark and empty.	
768	objBard	Usually it's all magical and full of puzzles!	
769	objMiriam	|Huh.	
770	objMiriam	Well,| perfect.	
771	objMiriam	This time I'll help you out.	
772	objMiriam	I can probably blow us through that stuff instantly.	
773	objBard	Well.|| OK!	
			
774	objBard	...|Maybe I should try singing that again.	
			
749	objBard	...|um...	
750	objBard	Hello...?	
751	objBard	Miriam...?	
752	objBard	She's not here...	
			
775	objBard	{size 1.8}...|It didn't work...

779	objMiriam	{}It's all these disgusting clouds in the sky...	
780	objBard	{}...||Guess I wasn't useful after all.	
781	objMiriam	{shake}Don't{/shake}| be like this right now!!	
782	objMiriam	This smog is definitely coming from the factory...	
783	objMiriam	We have to find a way to shut it down!	
784	objMiriam	Oh,| come on.	
785	objMiriam	Stop looking at me like that!!	
786	objMiriam	Seeing you like this is making me mad.	
792	objMiriam	{shake .5}I{/shake}| for one am not gonna sit around...	
793	objMiriam	While the hero prances around killing Overseers!	
794	objMiriam	So get back in there!

796	objMiriam	How to shut down the factory!	
			
797	objBard	{size 1.8}...|It didn't work...

799	objMiriam	Are you kidding me...	
800	objMiriam	The nexus point is |blocked!	
801	objBard	{}...||Guess I wasn't useful after all.	
802	objMiriam	{shake}Don't{/shake}| be like this right now!!	
803	objMiriam	...	
804	objMiriam	It's |probably| the disgusting smog in the sky...	
805	objMiriam	Which means...| we have to shut down the factory...	
806	objMiriam	So |I guess...| you were on the right track after all.	
807	objMiriam	{size .7}Ugh{/size}	
808	objMiriam	Y'know,| just once I'd like to be ahead of the curve.	
809	objBard	Sorry Miriam	
810	objMiriam	Whatever

812	objMiriam	I'll wander around as your hapless sidekick.

838	objBadriyah	Why don't you try it?	
839	objBadriyah	That was it!	
840	objBadriyah	The one that lets us walk on walls...

843	objBadriyah	You've |got| to talk to Amaris.|| It's the only way.	
844	objHala	Yeah, yeah.

883	objBalalaika	Part of me wishes to speak with her again...	
884	objBalalaika	But...	
885	objBalalaika	I suppose things| are...	
886	objBalalaika	Awkward...	
887	objBalalaika	Miriam and I are on seperate journies.	
888	objBalalaika	I can see now that it was never meant to be.	
889	objBalalaika	If only I'd the wisdom to know it when she did.	
890	objBalalaika	My heart still burns for her...	
891	objBalalaika	But,| in a respectful,	
892	objBalalaika	Non-romantic way.	
893	objBalalaika	In the cold,| dead city Chismest once was...	
894	objBalalaika	Miriam's passion burned loud and bright.	
895	objBalalaika	But now the people of Chismest are free.	
897	objBalalaika	And our dreams,| which were once frozen beneath the snow...	
898	objBalalaika	Can finally thaw and bloom here once more.	
899	objBalalaika	It is a new life for all of us here.	
			
900	objBalalaika	So.|| The factory is no more...	
901	objBalalaika	But my love...| she is leaving,| too.	
902	objBalalaika	||{wiggle}*Sigh*...{/wiggle}	
903	objBalalaika	Good news never comes without the bad close behind...	
904	objBalalaika	The time we shared was short.	
905	objBalalaika	And|| not particularly loving.	
906	objBalalaika	Perhaps she never really did love me.	
907	objBalalaika	But I will treasure our time together nonetheless.	
908	objBalalaika	With the factory gone,	
909	objBalalaika	The spirit of this town is free once more.	
910	objBalalaika	New hope can spring...	
911	objBalalaika	Perhaps,|| even for me...	
			
912	objBard	Hey...	
913	objBard	Wanna help overthrow the factory,| maybe?	
914	objBalalaika	Yes.	
915	objBard	We have meetings in the diner every night.

923	objBard	True.	
924	objBalalaika	...	
925	objBalalaika	She's perfect.	
926	objBalalaika	The factory has infected the very heart of this city...	
927	objBalalaika	Its darkness is suffocating.	
928	objBalalaika	||I| look forward to our nightly diner meeting.	
929	objBalalaika	My heart cannot bear this wait to see her...	
930	objBalalaika	|||Tonight...

932	objBalalaika	|"The Astronomers"	
933	objBalalaika	We see above the trappings of this machine city,	
934	objBalalaika	To a factory-free future...	
935	objBalalaika	The people of this city |must| be free of the factory.	
936	objBalalaika	We| the Astronomers| can see the path to that destiny...	
937	objBard	Hm...	
938	objBalalaika	These people are enslaved by machinery.	
939	objBalalaika	We'll stop the factory and establish a new order...	
941	objBalalaika	That is a bit more than what I had in mind...

954	objBalalaika	But what is a love that doesn't know second chances?	
955	objBard	Um.	
956	objBalalaika	Every moment without her is pain...	
957	objBalalaika	I await our meeting||| with continued sadness.

994	objBernie	When the mermaids vanished,	
995	objBernie	We were all left feeling despondent...

1162	objBronson	He's surely tougher than his old man!	
1163	objBronson	It's been difficult...

1165	objBronson	I hope||| I did a good job.	
1166	objBronson	Even if...	
1167	objBronson	He never will grow up.

1170	objBronson	I can't thank you enough...	
1171	objBronson	For bringing Mary back to us,| bardling.

1178	objBronson	The ghosts around town are proving quite a problem.	
1179	objBronson	I tried scaring off the one in our house with my axe...	
1180	objBronson	But it wasn't very afraid of axes.	
1181	objBronson	Hopefully the mayor can sort it soon.	
1182	objBronson	I can chop down trees,| but ghosts are beyond me.	
1183	objBronson	Maybe it's as Mary used to tell me...

1186	objBronson	I miss her...

1268	objBard	Does this mean I'm a hero now?	
1272	objCalliope	Uh...| hm.	
1273	objCalliope	I guess it might.	
1274	objCalliope	I'm gonna do another divination...	
1275	objCalliope	On {wiggle}you{/wiggle}|, this time.	
1276	objCalliope	{size .8}Let's see if you're really the hero foretold...	
1277	objCalliope	!	
1278	objCalliope	{size 1}Holy cow...	
1279	objCalliope	There's...!	
1280	objCalliope	No prophecy about you whatsoever.	
1281	objBard	...	
1282	objBard	...None?	
1283	objCalliope	None|| whatsoever.	
1284	objBard	What does that mean?	
1285	objCalliope	I don't even know!	
1286	objCalliope	Usually you at least see |{wiggle}something...{/wiggle}	
1287	objCalliope	You're for sure |NOT| {wiggle}the hero foretold...{/wiggle}	
1288	objCalliope	But I guess you're not| NOT a hero?	
1289	objCalliope	Destiny just has|| no expectations of you at all.	
1290	objCalliope	Well, good luck with that.	
1291	objCalliope	World's still ending.	
1292	objCalliope	I wanna get outta here and to the beach.	
1293	objCalliope	So time to scram,| okay?	
			
1302	objCalliope	So?|| Didja find the tear yet?	
1303	objBard	{shake}Yep!!!	
1304	objCalliope	{}Huh? Really?	
1305	objCalliope	Is it...|| tear shaped?	
1306	objBard	...	
1307	objBard	Well...|| not exactly.	
1308	objCalliope	So you didn't find it!	
1309	objCalliope	Maybe you got a piece of it,| but...	
1310	objCalliope	Without the whole thing,| it's useless!	
1311	objBard	Oh...	
1312	objBard	But then...| where's the rest?	
1313	objCalliope	{shake .5}How am I supposed to know???	
1314	objCalliope	{}Do I look like a hero to you?	
1315	objCalliope	That's why this isn't either of our jobs!	
1316	objCalliope	But hey...|| maybe you're on the right track!	
1317	objCalliope	Keep looking in other places!	
1318	objCalliope	What have you got to lose?	
1319	objCalliope	Good luck finding that jewel!	
1320	objCalliope	I'll wait around and see if you do.	
1321	objCalliope	The payoff would be {wiggle}pretty sweet{/wiggle}...	
1322	objCalliope	Nya ha ha ha...	
1323	objCalliope	That jewel would be worth a fortune.	
1324	objCalliope	And you |{shake}{quake}WOULD{/shake}|| have to hand it over,| by the way.	
1325	objCalliope	Mo' money,| better beach for me when the world ends.	
1326	objCalliope	Nya ha ha ha...	
1327	objCalliope	What are you hanging around here for?	
1328	objCalliope	Go do your heroic sidequest stuff already!!	
1329	objCalliope	If you take too long,| I won't get any pre-oblivion vacation time...	
1330	objCalliope	Still waiting,| {wiggle}hero!{/wiggle}	
1331	objCalliope	I already helped you enough!	
			
1332	objCalliope	!	
1333	objCalliope	What are you doing here?	
1334	objBard	Do you know about the Overseer song?	
1335	objCalliope	...|Overseer|.|.|.?	
1336	objCalliope	{quake}{shake}NYA{/shake}| ha ha ha!| Funny time to ask!	
1337	objCalliope	I hate to tell you this,| but...	
1338	objCalliope	{quake}{shake}THE WORLD IS ENDING!!!{/shake}	
1339	objCalliope	That's why I'm packing up my stuff.	
1340	objCalliope	Gonna go chill on a beach till it all goes down.	
1341	objBard	I know about that already!	
1342	objCalliope	Huh?| About the beach?	
1343	objBard	No,| about the world ending!	
1344	objBard	That's what I'm trying to stop!	
1345	objCalliope	...	
1346	objCalliope	{quake}{shake}NYA{/shake}| ha ha ha!	
1347	objCalliope	{wiggle}That's{/wiggle}| not gonna happen.	
1349	objCalliope	But sure.	
1350	objCalliope	I can divinate just about anything.	
1351	objCalliope	What are you looking for?| Overseer's song?	
1352	objBard	Yeah!	
1353	objCalliope	{wiggle}Hmmmm...{/wiggle}	
1354	objCalliope	{shake}GOT IT!	
1355	objCalliope	{}Apparently|| the mermaids know it.	
1356	objCalliope	Which is too bad...	
1357	objCalliope	Since they vanished years ago and all.	
1358	objCalliope	Even |{wiggle}I{/wiggle}| couldn't tell you where they went...	
1359	objBard	Oh...	
1360	objBard	So you can't really divinate {wiggle}anything{/wiggle}, huh...	
1361	objCalliope	Tuh!| Hey!| I'm the best in the biz,| okay??	
1362	objCalliope	But it's not that simple!	
1363	objCalliope	A divination like that would require...|| hard to find stuff!!	
1365	objBard	Like what?	
1366	objCalliope	Nya ha ha...|| you're serious,| huh?	
1368	objCalliope	To actually locate the mermaids...	
1369	objCalliope	I'd need no less than|| the {wiggle}Mermaid's Tear.{/wiggle}	
1370	objBard	Huh?| I have to make them cry?	
1371	objCalliope	{shake}NO{/shake} no no no	
1372	objCalliope	It's a jewel, you dummy.	
1373	objCalliope	Something they left behind.	
1374	objCalliope	You could go looking for it in the Ruins, I guess...	
1375	objCalliope	But be warned!	
1376	objCalliope	It's...|| a {wiggle}heroic sidequest thing!{/wiggle}	
1377	objBard	A wha?	
1378	objCalliope	The Tear is destined to be found by a hero.	
1379	objCalliope	Not...|| a weird song dork.	
1380	objCalliope	But|| if you |{wiggle}can{/wiggle}| get the jewel,| then I can find the mermaids.	
1381	objBard	Okay!| I WILL find it!!	
1382	objBard	And then we'll see who the hero is!!	
			
1383	objHala	Candra!	
1384	objCandra	||||Sis?	
1385	objHala	{shake .5}Candra!!!	
1386	objCandra	{}Am I seeing things?	
1387	objCandra	{}Hal,|| what are you doing in that mirror?	
1388	objHala	I need your help,| Can.	
1389	objHala	I need to talk to mom.	
1390	objCandra	{}Oh gosh,| Hal.	
1391	objCandra	She's been worried sick about you!	
1392	objCandra	We all have.	
1393	objCandra	What happened to you?	
1394	objHala	I died,| Can.	
1395	objCandra	I know |{wiggle}that!{}	
1396	objCandra	But wh||...|| how?	
1397	objHala	...An accident.	
1398	objCandra	||||An accident?	
1399	objCandra	That's all I get...?	
1400	objCandra	||...Everything's always a secret from me...	
1401	objCandra	They didn't even tell me when you vanished,| Hal.	
1402	objCandra	I'm not a baby anymore!	
1404	objHala	I'm sorry,| Can.	
1405	objHala	But...	
1406	objHala	I can't||| talk about it now...	
1407	objCandra	What do you need?	
1408	objHala	I'm tied down to this body	
1409	objBard	Hi,| by the way!	
1410	objBard	I'm a bard!	
1412	objHala	{size 1}But we don't have access to magic.	
1413	objHala	So how can we get into the palace?	
1414	objCandra	{}Hmmm...|| no magic...	
1415	objCandra	Wait a second...	
1416	objCandra	Did you say...|| you're a| singer?	
1417	objHala	Wha?	
1418	objHala	{shake}{quake}OH||hhhhhhhh...!!!	
1419	objHala	{/shake}That's right!	
1420	objBard	{}What?	
1421	objCandra	I was just studying this in class.	
1422	objCandra	It's a little known fact that magic...	
1423	objCandra	Is actually just |advanced|| music!	
1424	objBard	What!!!	
1426	objCandra	And way,| way,|| WAY back...	
1427	objCandra	We used to use songs to do magic.	
1428	objCandra	...Found it!	
1429	objCandra	Try singing this...	
1430	objCandra	It worked!	
1431	objBard	It worked?	
1432	objBard	I can do|| {shake}MAGIC?!{}	
1433	objCandra	Sort of...	
1434	objCandra	Singing is...|| primitive,| compared to real magic.	
1435	objCandra	But these crystals are extra magic-sensitive.	
1436	objCandra	So they'll respond to you.	
1440	objCandra	That's the only example song in the book...	
1442	objCandra	||I wish I could be more help.	
1443	objCandra	I bet Amaris would know tons more spell songs...	
1444	objHala	Oh no.	
1445	objHala	Not her...	
1446	objBard	Who?	
1447	objCandra	Our older sister.	
1448	objCandra	She's headmaster of this whole school.	
1449	objCandra	And,|| yeah,| a pain to deal with.	
1450	objHala	I don't want to see her.	
1451	objCandra	I don't think she wants to be |seen.	
1452	objCandra	By |{wiggle}anybody.	
1453	objCandra	{}She's been hiding at the top of her tower for...| weeks.	
1454	objCandra	There's also Badriyah...	
1455	objCandra	I can mark where she lives for you,| Hal.	
1456	objCandra	Maybe she can help too.	
1457	objHala	That's a |MUCH| better idea.	
1458	objHala	Thank you,| Can.	
1459	objCandra	I wanted to give you a hug just now,| but...	
1460	objCandra	I guess you're just a ghost in a mirror...	
1461	objCandra	...	
1462	objCandra	I love you,| Hal.	
1463	objHala	Love you too, sis.	
1464	objCandra	You know the story about the goddess Eya,	
1465	objCandra	Creating the universe with song...	
1466	objCandra	And all that,| right?	
1467	objCandra	According to the book,	
1468	objCandra	Since the universe is fundamentally just music,	
1469	objCandra	We discovered we could |use| music to manipulate it...	
1470	objCandra	And that's what evolved into magic.	
1471	objCandra	It sounds pretty crazy...	
1472	objCandra	But it does work,| so I guess it's true.	
1473	objCandra	I wish I could just take you to the palace myself.	
1474	objCandra	But you have to cast the spell yourself to get in...	
1475	objCandra	Write it down on your map so you don't forget it.	
1476	objCandra	...	
1477	objCandra	I don't know what to do,|| now...	
1478	objCandra	I have so many exams...	
1479	objCandra	I was keeping so busy...	
1480	objCandra	I'd managed to stop|| thinking,| about what happened...	
1481	objCandra	But now it's all coming back in such a rush...	
1482	objCandra	Oh,|| Hal...	
1483	objCandra	Whoever you are...	
1484	objCandra	Please take good care of Hal.	
1485	objCandra	All my sisters are too old and stuck up to be my friends.	
1486	objCandra	Except Hal.|| She was the best.	
1487	objCandra	She's a good person.	
1488	objCandra	|||I might start crying soon...	
1489	objCandra	Um...| I don't want you to be here for that.

3710	objBard	RIGHT???	
3711	objBard	{}Did we do it?	
3715	objBard	{}I thought it was over!	
3716	objBard	We never got the last piece of the Earthsong...	
3717	objAngel	{angel}|||I thought so too...	
3719	objAngel	But in the end|| it didn't matter!	
3720	objAngel	When you reached out with your voice,	
3721	objAngel	The whole world answered back	
3722	objAngel	And...|| Eya heard you!	
3723	objAngel	She saw you all workin together	
3724	objAngel	Just for a moment...	
3725	objAngel	And it was |just enough	
3726	objAngel	To harmonize with her new song!	
3730	objAngel	What you sang...	
3731	objAngel	Wasn't the Earthsong	
3732	objAngel	It was something special!	
3733	objAngel	That only you could've done	
3734	objAngel	And even after an infinite infinities	
3735	objAngel	Of universes beginning and ending and beginning again	
3736	objAngel	I've never seen anythin like it	
3737	objAngel	That's why I'm so proud of you two!	
3739	objAngel	Nobody ever tried like you did	
3740	objAngel	It wasn't even supposed to be possible!	
3741	objAngel	But you |MADE| it possible!

3746	objEduard	{size 1.2}Welcome to Mohabumi!	
3747	objEduard	Please take this complimentary guide map.	
			
3748	objBard	{size 1.2}Hey!	
3749	objBard	This map doesn't have anything on it...	
3750	objEduard	It will fill itself in as you visit different areas.	
3751	objEduard	Nonmagical persons will have trouble accessing much of the city.	
3752	objEduard	So we do not clutter the map with places you cannot see...	
3753	objEduard	{size 1.2}There's much to enjoy here in Mohabumi,	
3754	objEduard	Even if you are not magical.	
3755	objEduard	The main marketplace is just ahead.	
3756	objEduard	And if you are interested in the study of magic,	
3757	objEduard	The Academy is also on the ground floor...	
3758	objEduard	{size 1.2}As you may have noticed,| the city is entirely underground...	
3759	objEduard	We keep it lit by magical crystals.	
3760	objEduard	Visitors often find this unusual.	
3761	objEduard	But a vertically designed city is more space efficient,	
3762	objEduard	and convenient to navigate...|| if you can fly,| that is.	
			
3763	objEduard	Ahem.|| Hello.	
3764	objEduard	I'm the captain of this boat...	
3765	objEduard	And I'm also...|| the marimba player in the band.	
3766	objEduard	Of the 3 parts, I go first.	
3767	objEduard	Because I'm the captain.	
3768	objEduard	And captains are the leader.	
3769	objEduard	It's easily the most important part of the performance.	
3770	objEduard	I have to capture the audience's interest,	
3771	objEduard	And set up the rest of the song.	
3772	objEduard	But I don't have any music to play...	
3773	objEduard	Perhaps...|| you could compose it for me?	
3774	objBard	No way!	
3775	objBard	Sure!	
3776	objEduard	Are you going to compose my part?	
3777	objBard	Nah.	
3778	objBard	O|K!	
			
3779	objEduard	I see.	
3780	objEduard	So be it.	
			
3781	objEduard	Most excellent.	
3782	objEduard	Remember,| I'm the first to play.	
3783	objEduard	So please keep that in mind in your composition.	
3784	objEduard	You have the floor.	
3785	objEduard	This is my part, the first to play!	
3786	objEduard	Is it still to your liking?	
3787	objBard	It's good.	
3788	objBard	Let's change it!	
3789	objEduard	I must agree.	
3790	objEduard	Oh?|| Then,| be my guest.	
3791	objEduard	Remember,| I'm the first to play.	
3792	objEduard	So please keep that in mind in your composition.	
			
3793	objEduard	Hmm.|| Ahem.	
3794	objEduard	For a part as important as mine,	
3795	objEduard	I cannot accept something so simple...	
3796	objEduard	Can you expand on that a bit?	
3797	objBard	Not right now...	
3798	objBard	I'll try!	
3799	objEduard	Hmm!|| Ahem.	
3800	objEduard	That's||| an impressive piece of writing...	
3801	objEduard	But I cannot possibly remember all of that...	
3802	objEduard	Can you reduce its complexity?	
3803	objBard	Not right now...	
3804	objBard	I'll try!	
3805	objEduard	Then we are at an impasse.	
3806	objEduard	I must implore you to improve on your idea.	
3807	objEduard	Hmm.|| Hmmm!|| Shall this be it?	
3808	objBard	Let me try a|gain.	
3809	objBard	Yes!	
3810	objEduard	Hmm.|| Hmmm!|| Shall this be it?	
3811	objBard	Let me try a|gain.	
3812	objBard	Play the old one?	
3813	objBard	Yes!	
3814	objEduard	This is the original.	
3815	objBard	Let me sing a|gain.	
3816	objBard	Play what I just sang?	
3817	objBard	Re|place this!	
3818	objEduard	Most excellent!	
3819	objEduard	I believe I was the last one to need assistance.	
3820	objEduard	Now it's nearly time for the band to perform...	
3821	objEduard	My bandmates are likely in need as well.	
3822	objEduard	You should help them to follow up my performance.	
			
3823	objEm	You found us!	
3824	objEm	Yay!	
3825	objEm	I’m Em.	
3826	objEm	I did all the sound design in this game!	
3827	objEm	Which means I recorded and edited voices,| ambiences,| footsteps...	
3828	objEm	and a whole bunch of silliness.	
3829	objEm	I’m really grateful to have had the chance to be a part of Wandersong.	
3830	objEm	I think it’s really special.	
3831	objEm	And I’m so happy to have helped add something so positive to the world.	
3832	objEm	I’m also super grateful that you’ve taken the time to play it.	
3833	objEm	I hope you’ve enjoyed listening!	
3834	objEm	We all put a lot of energy and love into how this game sounds.	
3835	objEm	I think it’s a really important part of storytelling.	
3836	objEm	And that it can add so much value	
3837	objEm	to listen.	
3838	objEm	So it means a lot to me to have been able to work with Greg,	
3839	objEm	who really cared about it	
3840	objEm	right from the start!	
3841	objEm	We had a lot of fun making it together.	
3842	objEm	It feels crazy now	
3843	objEm	to be letting it all go.	
3844	objEm	All I hope, in the end	
3845	objEm	is that you’ve kept some of the feeling	
3846	objEm	that we shook out of our hearts.	
3847	objEm	I hope that it feels good. <3	
3848	objEm	Wandersong was the first game I worked on!	
3849	objEm	Way back in 2016	
3850	objEm	It’s what got me started in indie games.	
3851	objEm	I’ve worked on a few since then	
3852	objEm	but this one has been my biggest constant.	
3853	objEm	It’s also the one closest to my heart.	
3854	objEm	The themes that Greg explores really resonate with me.	
3855	objEm	And I think they’re super important ideas to spread right now.	
3856	objEm	So it’s been wonderful to contribute to that.	
3857	objEm	For me it’s pretty interesting to look back	
3858	objEm	From the beginning	
3859	objEm	all the way to the end	
3860	objEm	and hear how the sound changes.	
3861	objEm	It was really easy to grow with this game	
3862	objEm	because we made each act a different theme sonically.	
3863	objEm	There was a lot of experimentation!	
3864	objEm	Time for some fun facts!	
3865	objEm	There are 5|0|8|4|| sounds	
3866	objEm	That’s a lot for an indie game!	
3867	objEm	Greg and I voiced most of the characters.	
3868	objEm	Most of the sounds are recorded.	
3869	objEm	So many of those sounds are my voice.	
3870	objEm	A lot of the ambiences shift depending on where you are.	
3871	objEm	There are so so many silly details.	
3872	objEm	So silly.	
3873	objEm	Well...	
3874	objEm	Thanks for listening.	
3875	objEm	:)	
			
3876	objMiriam	{shake .5}Hey!!	
3877	objMiriam	{shake .5}Hey...	
3878	objMiriam	{shake .5}Wake up!!	
3879	objBard	{}...	
3880	objMiriam	It looked like something went wrong.	
3881	objMiriam	So I came|, um...	
3884	objMiriam	How did you even get in here?	
3885	objMiriam	You knew the Overseer song...?	
3886	objMiriam	Are you|| okay?	
3887	objBard	No!	
3888	objBard	I'm not the hero,| Miriam...	
3889	objBard	I'm not cool|| or strong|| or |||anything.	
3890	objBard	And I thought I could save the world||, but I can't.	
3891	objBard	So	
3892	objBard	I'm just gonna lie here	
3893	objBard	|||Forever	
3894	objBard	And everyone will forget about me	
3895	objBard	And then the world's gonna end.	
3896	objMiriam	That's dumb.	
3897	objMiriam	You're being really dumb.	
3900	objMiriam	Nobody ever thought you were a hero anyway.	
3902	objBard	That doesn't make me feel better at all!	
3903	objMiriam	I mean that's not what's|| good| about you!	
3904	objMiriam	You're good because you're always all happy and singy.	
3905	objMiriam	I wish |I| was like that.	
3906	objMiriam	I'm grumpy and useless...	
3907	objMiriam	You make everything better by being happy at it.	
3908	objBard	Well, I'm not happy now.	
3909	objBard	Even if we wanted to learn the Earthsong...	
3910	objBard	We can't now that an Overseer is dead.	
3911	objMiriam	Actually no.	
3912	objMiriam	You can talk to ghosts,| right?	
3913	objBard	Huh?	
3914	objMiriam	There's still ||something|| here...	
			
3915	objEphias	Rurururu!	
3916	objEphias	Welcome to my humble caravan!|| I hope you'll buy something...	
3917	objEphias	I have all kinds of plants and bugs I scavenged| in the wilderness!	
3918	objBard	Oh!|| I don't have any money...	
3919	objEphias	||Oh...| me neither...	
3920	objEphias	Nobody wants to do business with a panda||, rururu...	
3921	objBard	Are you really a panda?	
3922	objEphias	{shake}CHEE!!!{/shake}|| Yes!	
3923	objEphias	I've travelled all over the world with my caravan!	
3924	objEphias	But people here don't trust a talking red panda...

3926	objBard	I think you're neat!	
3927	objEphias	Rururu!|| Thank you kindly!	
3928	objEphias	Truthfully,| times are tough now...	
3929	objEphias	I had to sell my horse here for money...	
3930	objEphias	But I yearn for the open road again,| rururu...	
3931	objEphias	Have you ever lived in the wilderness?	
3932	objEphias	Rururururu!|| There's nothing better for me!	
3933	objEphias	The smell of trees...	
3934	objEphias	The sound of rain on the roof of my caravan...	
3935	objEphias	But to be honest,|| I've grown to love human food...	
3936	objEphias	I guess that's partly why I started needing money,| chee...	
3937	objEphias	Crossing the desert to get here was very tough!	
3938	objEphias	It was hot in all my fur...	
3939	objEphias	And I almost ran out of food!|| Chee!	
3940	objEphias	There's not much to scavenge in the desert...	
3941	objEphias	But I'd heard of a beautiful city on the other side!	
3942	objEphias	With my spirit of adventure,| I couldn't say no!	
3943	objEphias	...	
3944	objEphias	But now I'm trapped here...	
3945	objEphias	It's not easy...	
3946	objEphias	But no matter what,| I always keep a smile on!	
3947	objEphias	Thing will turn around!| Ruru!	
			
3948	objBard	Hi!|| About your yellow mushroom...	
3949	objBard	I need it for a potion!|| Can I have it?	
3950	objEphias	Rurururu...|| I wish I could just give it away...	
3951	objEphias	But I need money!| Badly!	
3952	objEphias	I had to sell my horse,| and now I'm trapped in this city...	
3953	objBard	Aaah!| I know...	
3954	objBard	Oh!| I'm sorry...!	
3955	objBard	But is there maybe something I could do|| in exchange for it?

3957	objEphias	{size 1}{shake}CHEE!!!{/shake}	
3958	objEphias	Well,| business has been very slow...	
3959	objEphias	So if there were a way you could help me with {wiggle}promotion...{/wiggle}	
3960	objEphias	For example...|| By performing in front of my caravan?	
3961	objBard	Not right now...	
3962	objBard	I can do that!	
3963	objEphias	Will you perform music for my shop?	
3964	objBard	Not right now...	
3965	objBard	I can do that!	
			
3966	objEphias	Rururu...| I understand...

3968	objEphias	{shake}CHEE!!!{/shake}	
3969	objEphias	You'll have to write a theme song for my shop...	
3970	objEphias	I have some guidelines for success with this!	
3971	objEphias	I may be a panda, after all,| but I understand humans very well!	
3972	objEphias	They like patterns!|| And repetition!	
3973	objEphias	Whatever song you write,| you're going to have to sing it over and over.	
3974	objEphias	{shake .3}Without changing anything!!!{/shake}	
3975	objEphias	So make it interesting...| but not too interesting!	
3976	objEphias	{size .7}{wiggle}Rururururu...{/wiggle}	
3977	objEphias	{}It would have to be...|| a {wiggle}little{/wiggle} more interesting than that!

3981	objEphias	Chee!	
3982	objEphias	That's way too complicated to remember...

3995	objEphias	Hmmm?	
3996	objEphias	You weren't singing...

4088	objFernando	Ha|HA!|| Let's go!	
4089	objEduard	And a one, ||two, ||three, ||four...	
4090	objFernando	...	
4091	objFernando	I'm not smashing my accordion this time.	
4092	objFernando	It's really expensive.	
4093	objFernando	Thanks for all the smiles,| amigo.	
4094	objEduard	May we meet again someday.	
			
4095	objFernando	Ola!	
4096	objFernando	Here for the show this evening?	
4097	objFernando	I'm in the band,| you know.	
4098	objFernando	And my part is the most important!	
4099	objFernando	I'm the last to play.	
4100	objFernando	The big finale!	
4102	objFernando	I'm the part everyone remembers long after the show!	
4103	objFernando	It must be exciting to meet me,| oi?	
4104	objFernando	There's just ||one small problem...	
4105	objFernando	...||our conductor lost the music.| Aiyaiyai!	
4106	objFernando	I could probably wing it and be fine by myself.	
4107	objFernando	But how would the band keep up with me?	
4108	objBard	There's just no way.	
4109	objBard	I could write a song!	
4110	objFernando	It must be exciting to meet me,| oi?	
4111	objBard	Yes, tell me more!	
4112	objBard	I'm here to write a song.	
4113	objFernando	Ola!	
4114	objFernando	Just waiting for the show tonight.	
4115	objBard	Can't wait!	
4116	objBard	I'm wri|ting your part!	
			
4117	objFernando	It's unfortunate but true.	
4118	objFernando	Wish them luck tonight.	
			
4119	objFernando	Well,| I was born just a normal witch in Mohabumi...	
4120	objFernando	But I always knew I was destined for greatness!	
4121	objFernando	Anyway,| enough of that.	
4123	objFernando	Our conductor lost the score for tonight.	
4124	objFernando	But it's no big deal!	
4125	objFernando	I'll be winging it!	
4126	objFernando	Wish me luck in the show tonight!	
			
4127	objFernando	Well,| you're gonna have to!	
			
4128	objFernando	What?|| {shake .5}YOU?{}	
4129	objFernando	Think you can make something worthy of the big finale?	
			
4130	objFernando	Well,| let's see what you got!	
4131	objFernando	This is it!!!|| The big finale!	
4132	objBard	Heck yeah!	
4133	objBard	Let's change it!	
4134	objFernando	No problem!	
4135	objFernando	Show me what you got!	
			
4136	objFernando	Ola!| My amigo from the boat!	
4137	objFernando	Are you enjoying Mohabumi?	
4138	objFernando	This just so happens...	
4139	objFernando	To be right near my favorite place in the city!	
4140	objFernando	The Crater theater!	
4141	objFernando	All the best musicians in the world come here!	
4142	objFernando	I would play here myself,| but...	
4143	objFernando	I smashed my accordion.	
4144	objFernando	Perhaps I did not think that through.	
4145	objFernando	You must always follow the music.	
4146	objFernando	That's the spirit of a true musician!	
4147	objFernando	And,| sometimes...	
4148	objFernando	The music tells you to smash your accordion.	
4149	objFernando	And light it on fire!	
4150	objFernando	No one can say why she asks us this.	
4151	objFernando	But when you become a musician,	
4152	objFernando	You pledge your allegiance to her whims.	
4153	objFernando	You have the spirit of a true musician.	
4154	objFernando	I did not know it when I met you...	
4155	objFernando	But now!|| I can feel it!	
4156	objFernando	Yours shines bright as mine!	
4157	objFernando	We are kindred spirits,| amigo.	
4158	objFernando	Carry the music in your heart wherever you go.	
			
4159	objFernando	Ummm.	
4160	objFernando	The big finale's gotta have more notes than that.	
4161	objFernando	I'm sorry,| it's just a rule.	
4162	objBard	Can't do it.	
4163	objBard	I'll try!	
4164	objFernando	Whooaaa!!!	
4165	objFernando	That's quite complex!	
4166	objFernando	Heh...|| but I can handle it.	
4169	objFernando	Seriously?	
4170	objFernando	O|K| then,| amigo.	
4171	objFernando	Does this sound like a big finale to you...?	
4172	objBard	Let me try a|gain.	
4173	objBard	This is it!	
4174	objFernando	Hey,| this works...	
4175	objBard	Let me try a|gain.	
4176	objBard	Play the old one?	
4177	objBard	This is it!	
4178	objFernando	This is the old one...	
4179	objBard	Let me sing a|gain.	
4180	objBard	Play what I just sang?	
4181	objBard	Re|place this!	
4182	objFernando	No sweat!	
4183	objFernando	Looks like we got ourselves a finale.	
4184	objFernando	Now we just gotta perform it!	
4185	objFernando	Just gotta make sure the band's with us!	
			
4186	objFlowersteal	Well?|| Wanna take it?	
4187	objBard	No!	
4188	objBard	Yeah!	
4189	objMiriam	Well,| okay...	
			
4190	objSandra	Oh crap!!!|| It's bigger than we thought!	
4191	objVivian	{shake}{quake}NO BIG DEAL!!!{/shake}	
4192	objVivian	Remember our training!	
4193	objSandra	{shake}{quake}{glitch .6}GAH!!!	
4194	objVivian	{quake}What are these things???	
			
4195	objMiriam	{shake}{name}!!!{/shake}	
4196	objMiriam	The heck are you doing here???	
4197	objBard	Um!|| Well...	
4198	objBard	The walls are too high for me to jump out...	
4199	objBard	These witches said they needed help...	
4200	objMiriam	{shake}{quake}Irresponsible!!!{/shake}	
4201	objMiriam	This thing is dangerous!!!	
4202	objMiriam	I can't believe they let you jump in here...	
4203	objMiriam	...	
4204	objMiriam	I guess| there's no stopping it,| so...	
4205	objMiriam	I guess| I'll help fight this thing.	
4206	objMiriam	But only to save |{wiggle}your{/wiggle}| butt!	
			
4207	objVivian	{shake}HECK YEAH!!!	
4208	objSandra	Another down!!!	
4209	objBard	{}Woohoo!	
4210	objMiriam	{{shake .6}DON'T |"WOOHOO"| THIS!!!	
4211	objMiriam	{}These stupid witches nearly got us killed!	
4212	objMiriam	Twice now!	
4213	objMiriam	What's the deal,| huh?	
4214	objMiriam	What was that thing??	
4215	objVivian	We don't know,| boss!	
4216	objVivian	They started appearing recently...	
4217	objMiriam	You mean...||| they aren't |{qiggle}yours?{/wiggle}	
4218	objVivian	{wiggle}Ours?{/wiggle}|| What do you mean?	
4219	objMiriam	Um. |I thought the monsters were...	
4220	objMiriam	{size .8}Uh...	
4221	objMiriam	Like...|| a witchy thing...?	
4222	objVivian	{shake}WHAT?{/shake}|| No way,| boss!	
4223	objVivian	They're a total mystery to us!	
4224	objVivian	All we know is...	
4225	objVivian	They showed up around when the princess disappeared...	
4226	objMiriam	Oh...|| the princess...	
4227	objVivian	Yeah,| the princess!	
4228	objVivian	And the weird thing is...	
4229	objVivian	They grow out of the...|| ground?	
4230	objVivian	And they don't seem to have a mind of their own...	
4232	objSandra	{shake}VIVIAN!!!{}	
4233	objSandra	Don't forget!!	
4234	objSandra	Civilians aren't supposed to know all this stuff!!!	
4235	objVivian	Oh.|| Yeah.	
4236	objVivian	Sorry!	
4237	objVivian	Military secrets,| I guess.	
4238	objVivian	But since you helped us take that thing down...	
4239	objVivian	We can trust you to keep all this between us,| hey?	
4240	objVivian	Where did you say you were headed to,| anyways?	
4242	objMiriam	We're going to the capital...|| I guess...	
4243	objSandra	Oh!|| You mean Mohabumi?	
4244	objSandra	That's easy!!	
4245	objSandra	We can help you get there no problem!	
4246	objSandra	Want us to give you a lift?	
4247	objMiriam	{size .7}no	
4249	objMiriam	{size .7}You busted my broom.	
4250	objSandra	{}{quake}{shake .2}That's what I'm saying!!!	
4251	objSandra	{}We can make up for it!	
4252	objBard	(I feel like we should go with them,| Miriam...)	
4253	objMiriam	{size .7}...	
			
4254	objFrancine	Bardlet!	
4255	objFrancine	Oh,| goodness...	
4256	objFrancine	I didn't think I'd ever see you again!	
4257	objFrancine	Marley and I missed you so much.	
4258	objFrancine	It's certainly been a time,| here...	
4259	objFrancine	It's as the spirits warned us,| I suppose...	
4260	objFrancine	I can't believe it's the end...	
4261	objFrancine	It's been so hard for us,| with all this...	
4262	objFrancine	Especially Ruby...	
4263	objFrancine	I was so worried for her...	
4264	objFrancine	But the mayor told me not to worry,	
4265	objFrancine	And to be with Marley instead...	
4266	objFrancine	She's been tending to Ruby in my place.	
4267	objFrancine	She's...|| so gracious,| bardlet.	
4268	objFrancine	The mayor,| I mean.	
4269	objFrancine	I admire her strength so much.	
4270	objFrancine	She really cares about us.	
4271	objFrancine	I wish...|| I could be a person like her.	
4272	objFrancine	I wish I still had time to become that person.	
4273	objFrancine	All these people mean so much to me...	
4274	objFrancine	Langtree really is a special place.	
4275	objFrancine	You always belonged here with us,| bardlet.	
4276	objFrancine	I'm so glad...	
4277	objFrancine	I got to see you again.	
			
4278	objFrancine	Bardlet!|| Oh,| goodness...	
4279	objFrancine	A |{shake}dark||| spirit{/shake}|| appeared in Ruby's house...	
4280	objFrancine	I tried to get her out, but...	
4281	objFrancine	Well,| you know how stubborn she can be...	
4282	objFrancine	She's such a sweet,| sweet old girl!	
4283	objFrancine	If something happened to her,| I...	
4284	objFrancine	I thought about getting help,| but...	
4285	objFrancine	What if something happens while I'm gone?	
4286	objFrancine	I'm so terrified,|| I can't| move!	
4287	objFrancine	I'm so embarrassed...	
			
4288	objFrancine	Well?||#Is Ruby alright??	
4289	objBard	...	
4290	objBard	She's great.	
4291	objFrancine	Thank goodness!	
4292	objFrancine	You really are a hero, bardlet.	
4293	objFrancine	Ruby's just||| so kind and gentle...	
4294	objFrancine	A sweet woman like her| doesn't deserve to be haunted!	
4295	objBard	...	
4296	objFrancine	The mayor will certainly be happy to hear the spirits are taken care of!	
4297	objFrancine	Goodness knows she was worried...	
4298	objFrancine	The mayor will certainly be happy to hear the spirits are taken care of!	
4299	objFrancine	Goodness knows she was worried...	
4300	objFrancine	Thank you for helping Ruby,| bardlet...	
4301	objFrancine	I wonder what a nasty spirit like that could want with the poor old girl...	
4302	objFrancine	When I was a little girl, Ruby would sing at the Tree of Slumber.	
4303	objFrancine	It was supposedly a ritual to commune with the Overseer...	
4304	objFrancine	But he never did speak to us.	
4305	objFrancine	I know Ruby can be a little harsh at times.	
4306	objFrancine	But her heart is good...|| just old,| and tested.	
4307	objFrancine	Now that Ron is back, Ruby seems|| happier.	
4308	objFrancine	Personally,| I still find him a bit spooky as a ghost...	
4309	objFrancine	I'd been so distracted helping Ruby, I've barely seen Marley...	
4310	objFrancine	I'm grateful she's so understanding.	
			
4311	objFrancisco	Why,| if it isn't the silly one.	
4312	objFrancisco	Back for more, huh?	
4313	objFrancisco	Just kidding.	
4315	objFrancisco	The truth is...	
4316	objFrancisco	This whole crew's as silly as they come.	
4317	objFrancisco	I've been fooling myself denying the obvious truth.	
4318	objFrancisco	It's good to have you back.	
4319	objFrancisco	So,| actually...	
4320	objFrancisco	I've been thinking about quitting coffee.	
4321	objFrancisco	...|Yeah...	
4322	objFrancisco	I don't sleep great on it.	
4323	objFrancisco	And it makes me feel anxious all the time.	
4324	objFrancisco	I haven't even had any today yet.	
4325	objFrancisco	The sky is exploding with glowing stars,	
4326	objFrancisco	So it hasn't been too hard to stay awake.	
			
4327	objFrancisco	When you first showed up on our boat,	
4328	objFrancisco	I was sure you were going to be a huge nuisance.	
4329	objFrancisco	And I was right...	
4330	objFrancisco	But| I'll miss you anyway.	
4331	objFrancisco	Good luck on whatever strange,| silly thing you're doing next...	
4332	objFrancisco	Hey,| before you go...	
4333	objFrancisco	Be honest...	
4334	objFrancisco	Do you think| I have a scary face?	
4335	objBard	No!	
4336	objBard	Yes.	
4337	objFrancisco	Huh.|| Okay...	
4338	objFrancisco	I feel like I do,	
4339	objFrancisco	But it's hard to get a straight answer from people.	
4340	objFrancisco	I figured...	
4341	objFrancisco	Sorry if it was weird to ask that now.	
4342	objFrancisco	I just always wonder...	
4343	objFrancisco	OK,| see yah.	
			
4344	objFrancisco	Wow.|| Well.	
4345	objFrancisco	Thanks for dealing with that idiot.	
4346	objFrancisco	I took you to be too silly to do anything useful.	
4347	objFrancisco	I'm glad you proved me wrong.	
4348	objFrancisco	Now that I think about it,	
4349	objFrancisco	We've actually gotten into a ton more trouble since you showed up.	
4350	objFrancisco	Chaos just seems to follow you around...	
4352	objFrancisco	Um.|| I'm not trying to be mean.	
4353	objFrancisco	You know|||, after all that excitement...	
4354	objFrancisco	I could really go for some coffee.	
			
4355	objFrancisco	Egad!	
4356	objFrancisco	What's happening?|| Everyone's gone nuts...	
4357	objFrancisco	Did you do this?	
4358	objFrancisco	Captain Lucas says we're searching for mermaids?	
4359	objFrancisco	What?	
4360	objFrancisco	Didn't they disappear years ago?	
4361	objFrancisco	I was fine just selling beans...	
			
4362	objFrancisco	I got put on duty to sell the coffee beans.	
4363	objFrancisco	Usually it's Penny's job...	
4364	objFrancisco	...	
4365	objFrancisco	Ugh.|| I'm so bored.	
4368	objFrancisco	We're always drinking coffee,| so we practically never sleep on that ship.	
4369	objFrancisco	I don't know how anyone can handle this without sleep,| though.	
4370	objFrancisco	I want to stab everyone.||| In the face.	
4371	objFrancisco	Would you like some {wiggle}coffeeeeee| beeeeeaaans?{/wiggle}	
4372	objFrancisco	Would |{wiggle}you{}| like some {wiggle}cooooooffee beeeeeaaans??{/wiggle}	
4373	objFrancisco	{shake .25}Would |{wiggle}anyone{/wiggle}| like some {wiggle}coooffeeee beeeeeaaans???	
			
4374	objFrancisco	Nothing like a cup of coffee after a long day.	
4375	objFrancisco	Hopefully everyone got all that singing out of their system.	
4376	objFrancisco	I'll sleep great tonight.|| Ha ha,| just kidding.	
			
4377	objFrancisco	Ugh,| I'm so tired.	
4378	objFrancisco	I can't even remember the last time I slept...	
4379	objFrancisco	...So why do I still want more coffee?	
4380	objFrancisco	I'm the navigator for this ship.	
4381	objFrancisco	Meaning I keep us pointed in the right direction.	
4382	objFrancisco	And that goes {wiggle .25}beyond{} the literal.	
4383	objFrancisco	I don't tolerate silliness.	
4384	objBard	...	
4385	objBard	Heh!| Me neither!	
4386	objBard	I'm on a {wiggle}serious{/wiggle} adventure.	
4387	objFrancisco	...	
4388	objFrancisco	You seem like the silly type to me.	
4389	objFrancisco	Of course they just let you on the ship without consulting me.	
4390	objFrancisco	I mean.| That's fine.	
4391	objFrancisco	Just| please don't break anything.	
			
4392	objFrancisco	{shake}SIGH.	
4393	objFrancisco	{}Another mug lost.| Fabulous.	
4394	objFrancisco	{shake}URGH.	
4395	objFrancisco	{}Please |{wiggle}try{/wiggle}| to be careful with those?	
4396	objFrancisco	{shake}Who keeps giving this troublemaker coffee??	
4397	objFrancisco	{shake}Those mugs|| aren't cheap!!!{/shake}	
4398	objFrancisco	Or I mean,| they are,|| relatively speaking...	
4399	objFrancisco	{quake}{shake}BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT!{/shake}	
4400	objFrancisco	Stop| breaking them!!!	
4401	objFrancisco	Are you...	
4402	objFrancisco	Come| {wiggle}on.	
4403	objFrancisco	...	
			
4404	objFrannie	Stranger!	
4405	objBard	Uh...	
4406	objBard	Miriam?	
4407	objBard	{shake}{quake}MIRIAM!!!{}	
4408	objMiriam	{shake}{quake}I'M AWAKE I'M AWAKE!!!{}	
4409	objMiriam	Sheesh...	
4410	objFrannie	The spirit...	
4411	objFrannie	Is it really gone?	
4412	objBard	Yep!	
4413	objFrannie	Maybe we were all wrong about you.	
4414	objFrannie	We thought you were from...|| over the border...	
4415	objBard	||...Huh?	
4416	objFrannie	You must |REALLY| be a stranger to these parts, hey?	
4417	objBard	We sure are!	
4418	objFrannie	Well,| let me make things simple for ya.	
4419	objFrannie	Around here, there are two big kingdoms.	
4420	objFrannie	Rulle...|| that's us,| in the east...	
4421	objFrannie	And Chaandesh|, in the west.	
4422	objFrannie	We've been at war for generations...	
4423	objBard	...|Why?	
4424	objOlaf	A great |MANY| reasons, traveller!	
4425	objOlaf	Their assaults on us are neverending!	
4426	objOlaf	Even this very forest...	
4427	objOlaf	It once was lush with trees and flowers.	
4428	objOlaf	But the Chaandesh burned it down!	
4429	objOlaf	They have no regard for nature...	
4430	objFrannie	We're in no man's land on the border here.	
4431	objFrannie	So we always gotta keep watch for spies.	
4432	objFrannie	That ghost you chased off...|| she was Chaandesh,| too.	
4433	objBard	She gave me a message!	
4434	objBard	For the King of Rulle...	
4435	objFrannie	A message for our king,| from Chaandesh?	
4436	objFrannie	That can't be any good.	
4437	objMiriam	What's the message?	
4438	objBard	I don't know...	
4439	objBard	But she said it would end the war!	
4440	objBard	I can feel it |waiting| in me...	
4442	objBard	I think we should deliver it!	
4443	objMiriam	{size .7}Why does this crap always happen to us...	
4444	objBard	{}Wha?	
4445	objMiriam	I said great!	
4446	objMiriam	Let's go deliver this ghost message to the King!	
4447	objBard	Yeah!	
4448	objFrannie	...	
4449	objFrannie	I appreciate the favor you did me and my inn,| stranger.	
4450	objFrannie	So I won't| stop you...	
4451	objFrannie	But I will say||...| be careful with a message like that.	
4452	objFrannie	It's probably hard to understand cause you ain't from here,	
4453	objFrannie	But anything from Chaandesh...|| we've learned not to trust.	
4457	objBard	Whaaa|aaa|a|at?	
4458	objBard	But she seemed so nice!	
4459	objBard	I mean,|| she was all haunty and scary,	
4460	objBard	And she attacked me with rainbow ghost balls,	
4461	objBard	But...	
4462	objBard	After that,|| she was nice!	
4463	objBard	I'm sure it's fine.	
4464	objFrannie	...	
4465	objMiriam	...	
4466	objFrannie	Good luck on your journey, stranger.	
4467	objFrannie	It's a bit ugly out here...| but past the wall it's real nice.	
4468	objFrannie	Especially if you make it to the capital, Xiatian.	
4469	objFrannie	Rulle's a beautiful place where it's not a burned mess.	
4470	objFrannie	A lot of dangerous types come through here.	
4471	objFrannie	I inherited this place from my folks, but the area's no good anymore.	
4472	objFrannie	Why they bothered to rebuild after the fire's beyond me.	
4473	objFrannie	But for those sorry few out here,| it's their only refuge.	
			
4474	objMiriam	Um.| Hi.	
4475	objMiriam	We want to stay here.	
4476	objFrannie	Hmmm.	
4477	objMiriam	...	
4478	objFrannie	Hmmmmmm...	
4479	objMiriam	...|||Uh...	
4480	objFrannie	Well you can't.	
4481	objFrannie	All the rooms are taken.	
4482	objFrannie	Except for one.	
4483	objFrannie	And that one...| is haunted.	
4484	objMiriam	...|What?|| Really?	
4485	objFrannie	Normally I'd be completely kidding.	
4486	objFrannie	But right now I'm not.	
4487	objMiriam	Hey,| {name}...	
4488	objMiriam	Can't |{wiggle}you{/wiggle}| sing to ghosts or whatever?	
4489	objBard	Yeah,| I can!	
4490	objFrannie	...|Really?	
4491	objMiriam	Normally we'd be completely kidding,	
4492	objMiriam	Except we never are,| because we're an actual walking joke.	
4493	objFrannie	...	
4494	objFrannie	Well,| if you're willing to brave it...	
4495	objFrannie	It's the very last door upstairs.	
4496	objFrannie	Just be careful.	
4497	objFrannie	It's a mean ghost.	
4498	objFrannie	...	
4499	objFrannie	Don't try anything funny...	
4500	objFrannie	It's the last door in the hall upstairs.	
			
4501	objFrannie	Hey,| stranger.	
4502	objFrannie	What do you think you're doing here?	
			
4503	objSue	Oh,| you!	
4504	objFrederick	The performer from the Crazy Raven,| isn't it?	
4505	objSue	The one who got us together...	
4506	objSue	Cool seeing you again.	
4507	objSue	It's been a real rollercoaster here.	
4508	objSue	I think the world almost ended.	
4509	objSue	I don't know if I would have managed...	
4510	objSue	Without Frederick to talk me through it.	
4511	objSue	So,| thanks.	
4512	objFrederick	It's true.	
4513	objFrederick	And I don't know where I'd be without Sue...	
4514	objFrederick	She's taught me so much.	
4515	objFrederick	I'm trying to be less critical now.	
4516	objFrederick	You are a kind person...	
4517	objFrederick	And I appreciate you.	
4518	objFrederick	How did I do?	
4519	objFrederick	Have you heard the new Holmes Sweets theme song?	
4520	objFrederick	It has some nice qualities to it.	
4521	objFrederick	But does it stand out in the crowded "Candy Shop" genre?	
4522	objFrederick	I think not.	
4523	objFrederick	Blah blah music blah	
4524	objFrederick	Blah blah blah|| {wiggle}allegrissimo{/wiggle}| blah	
4525	objFrederick	Blah blah blah compilation of every good song| ever done| by anybody	
4526	objFrederick	...	
4527	objFrederick	I'm going to try to be less critical from now on.	
4528	objFrederick	OK.	
4529	objFrederick	Your show...	
4530	objFrederick	It was actually very fun.	
4531	objFrederick	I have no complaints about it.	
4532	objFrederick	I'm actually a very talented critic, I'll have you know.	
4533	objFrederick	No matter how good something is,	
4534	objFrederick	I can always find something wrong with it.	
4535	objFrederick	I've never heard truly |"good"| music before.	
4536	objFrederick	Nothing is perfect.	
4537	objFrederick	{wiggle}Someone{/wiggle}| has to be there to point that out.	
4538	objFrederick	My great taste extends to all things.	
4539	objFrederick	Nice outfit,| by the way.	
4540	objFrederick	Yes,| I saw your show.	
4541	objFrederick	Everyone in the town may have loved it,	
4542	objFrederick	But| I...	
4543	objFrederick	Well,|| I thought it was ||{wiggle}pretty...| good...{/wiggle}	
4544	objFrederick	It could have used some improvement though.	
4545	objFrederick	Here and there.	
4546	objFrederick	If you need |{wiggle}me{/wiggle} to tell you what the problems were...	
4547	objFrederick	I just don't think you'll make it as a musician.	
			
4548	objFrederick	What a nice song.	
4549	objFrederick	Hmm.| I don't know if that piece was for me.	
4550	objFrederick	But music needn't please everyone.	
4551	objFrederick	That piece reminds me of another I've heard before.	
4552	objFrederick	But you brought an original spin to it!	
4553	objFrederick	Nicely done.	
			
4554	objFrederick	That was a nice effort.	
4555	objFrederick	But I think it needed more| allegrato on its| fortissimo.	
4556	objFrederick	If you don't know what that means,	
4557	objFrederick	You'll probably never make it as a musician.	
4558	objFrederick	Hmm.| I'm not sure if that piece landed with me.	
4559	objFrederick	What sort of genre were you going for?	
4560	objFrederick	That was an |interesting number,| certainly.	
4561	objFrederick	But if you think that was original,	
4562	objFrederick	You're sadly mistaken.	
4563	objFrederick	I've absolutely heard that melody before.	
			
4564	objFrederick	That song...!	
4565	objFrederick	It's so|| full of...	
4566	objFrederick	{quake}{shake .8}Flaws!{/shake}	
4567	objBard	Well,| someone wrote it for you...| hehe!	
4568	objFrederick	You mean,| someone wrote a song...	
4569	objFrederick	Just for me?	
4570	objFrederick	{quake}{shake .3}To critique?{/shake}	
4571	objFrederick	Direct me to that person at once!	
4572	objFrederick	I won't keep them waiting!	
			
4573	objGabe	I've travelled all over the world...	
4574	objGabe	But I've never seen a city like this!	
4575	objGabe	Mohabumi is really a magical place!	
4576	objGabe	Literally!|| Because it's magic!!	
4577	objGabe	Without magic,| it's hard to reach most of the city...	
4578	objGabe	But there's so much to see in the tourist areas!	
4579	objGabe	I visited the Academy and sat in a class there.	
4580	objGabe	It was a little pointless,	
4581	objGabe	But it was interesting seeing how witches learn!	
4582	objGabe	I'm writing a travel guide,| actually...	
4583	objGabe	I want to see everything the world has to offer!	
4584	objGabe	What about you?	
4585	objGabe	Where do you think I should go next?	
4586	objBard	Lang|tree!	
4587	objBard	Del|phi!	
4588	objBard	Ta|tan|go!	
4589	objBard	Chis|mest!	
4590	objBard	Xia|tian!	
4591	objGabe	Lang||tree...?	
4592	objBard	It's in a forest!	
4593	objBard	It's really small and it's really far from here,	
4594	objBard	But it's| special!	
4595	objGabe	Hmm,| OK!	
4596	objGabe	Delphi! I know that place.	
4597	objGabe	I hear the leaves are pretty in the autumn.	
4598	objBard	There's a really cool band from there,| too!	
4599	objBard	{size .6}(Heh heh...)	
4600	objGabe	Tatango!|| Where is that again?	
4601	objBard	It's an island in the ocean!	
4602	objBard	There's pirates there!	
4603	objBard	And magical mermaids!	
4604	objBard	Oh wait,|| maybe not mermaids.	
4605	objBard	But!|| Pirates!!	
4606	objGabe	Hmm,| OK!	
4607	objGabe	Chismest!|| Really?	
4608	objGabe	It's pretty far out there...	
4609	objBard	Yeah,| it's cold.	
4610	objBard	But you can see the annual lights!	
4611	objBard	And my mom lives there!	
4612	objGabe	Should I visit your mom for my travel guide?	
4613	objBard	Maybe!	
4614	objBard	She's great.	
4615	objGabe	Xiatian?|| That might be hard...	
4616	objGabe	They have the crazy border wall...	
4617	objGabe	It was hard enough getting into Chaandesh!	
4618	objGabe	Is it worth the effort?	
4619	objBard	Yeah!	
4620	objBard	It's sunny!	
4621	objBard	And a lot of the people are really nice.	
4622	objGabe	Hmm,| OK!	
			
4623	objGabe	Oh,| wow!	
4624	objGabe	I travelled here on your recommendation.	
4625	objGabe	Remember?	
4626	objGabe	But I didn't expect I'd see you again!	
4627	objGabe	There's something special,	
4628	objGabe	About seeing a familiar face in a strange place.	
4629	objGabe	I've got to put that in my travel guide!	
4630	objGabe	I really like,|| um...	
4631	objGabe	This place's small-town feel!	
4632	objGabe	I notice some houses are missing roofs.	
4633	objGabe	And the locals seem to enjoy standing outside,	
4634	objGabe	Staring bleakly at the apocalypse.	
4635	objGabe	It's kind of an intimidating group dynamic...	
4636	objGabe	That's why I'm standing over here.	
4637	objGabe	Delphi really seems like a lively,| fun place.	
4638	objGabe	I'm excited to see that band you mentioned!	
4639	objGabe	I really enjoyed Tatango.	
4640	objGabe	Who knew pirates were so fun?	
4641	objGabe	It made me antsy to try a high seas adventure of my own...	
4642	objGabe	That's why I'm here now!	
4643	objGabe	I'll have a whole chapter of pirate adventures!	
4644	objGabe	This really feels like a place of change.	
4645	objGabe	I can tell the people are struggling...	
4646	objGabe	But there's hope for the future!	
4647	objGabe	The new lab is the biggest I've ever seen!	
4648	objGabe	I wonder what wonderful things they'll discover there!	
4649	objGabe	You were right!|| It was worth the trip!	
4650	objGabe	I've never seen trees like this...	
4651	objGabe	And all the cute animals!	
4652	objGabe	Er,|| Qin...	
4653	objGabe	You can really feel the spirit of nature here.	
			
4654	objGert	Hmm?| I'm reading...	
4655	objBard	...	
4656	objBard	What's the book?	
4657	objGert	Ummm.|| It's a fiction story.	
4658	objBard	That's cool!	
4659	objBard	What a|bout?	
4660	objGert	It's a lot to get into.	
4661	objBard	Got|cha.	
4662	objBard	Tell me!	
4663	objGert	Uh,|| well	
4664	objGert	There's these four kids who decide to play a game	
4665	objGert	But the game brings about the end of the universe	
4666	objGert	And they have to go on a sort of planetary quest	
4667	objGert	To collect materials and make a new universe	
4668	objGert	And there's aliens and time travel involved	
4669	objGert	...it's a lot to get into.

4752	objGonzalo	It's easy to get lost in Mohabumi...

4755	objGonzalo	Wait...|| Down!| That's it!

4758	objGord	Oh hey!	
4759	objGord	You're here :)	
4760	objGord	My name's Gord.	
4761	objGord	I did the music for Wandersong	
4762	objGord	Greg helped write a lot of the songs though!	
4763	objGord	Em wrote one too :)	
4764	objGord	The campfire one.	
4765	objGord	I bet you liked it.	
4766	objGord	I'm not gonna lie	
4767	objGord	This game was tough!	
4768	objGord	As soon as I agreed to work on it I was like,	
4769	objGord	What have I done	
4770	objGord	But I knew I really wanted to work with Greg	
4771	objGord	And that anything he was gonna make was gonna be good	
4772	objGord	And I guess I must have been feeling like I wanted a challenge???	
4773	objGord	I don't actually remember	
4774	objGord	But I knew early on there was a pretty big chance I was gonna burn out	
4775	objGord	Or screw up	
4776	objGord	Or run out of music to write	
4777	objGord	This game has	
4778	objGord	{shake}SO	
4779	objGord	MUCH	
4780	objGord	MUSIC	
4781	objGord	{}It scared the crap outta me	
4782	objGord	But hey you're here!	
4783	objGord	& I'm here!	
4784	objGord	We made it!	
4785	objGord	2017 was a hard year for me	
4786	objGord	Something I thought I KNEW was true my whole life	
4787	objGord	Turned out not to be so true after all?	
4788	objGord	The world has been so angry	
4789	objGord	And though I started on Wandersong before then	
4790	objGord	It suddenly became a whole lot more important	
4791	objGord	To invert cynicism for once in my life	
4792	objGord	(I am cynical; I like cynical things).	
4793	objGord	To contribute to something whose sole purpose is to make people happy	
4794	objGord	But not like, shallow happy,	
4795	objGord	like a sitcom or whatever	
4796	objGord	REALLY happy;	
4797	objGord	To shine a little light for people whose lives are feeling truly dark.	
4798	objGord	(I'm feeling way better now by the way.)	
4799	objGord	This is the biggest soundtrack I've ever done	
4800	objGord	It might be the biggest soundtrack ever???	
4801	objGord	It will probably be the biggest I'll ever do	
4802	objGord	It's like 4 and a half hours long?!	
4803	objGord	The plan was to be really minimalist so we'd finish	
4804	objGord	And I stuck to that plan until like halfway through Act 2	
4805	objGord	And then nothing was minimalist	
4806	objGord	I am super bad at minimalism	
4807	objGord	I recorded live performances on 24 different instruments in this game	
4808	objGord	I have no idea how many digital instruments are used.	
4809	objGord	A lot.	
4810	objGord	OH and you know that last big song at the end of the game?	
4811	objGord	The one where everyone sings together?	
4812	objGord	We got a choir for that.	
4813	objGord	But not like a real choir	
4814	objGord	I just asked twitter who wanted to sing for us	
4815	objGord	75 people sang for us!	
4816	objGord	Some people had fancy mics,	
4817	objGord	Some people sang into their phones & laptops	
4818	objGord	Some people sang beautifully	
4819	objGord	Some people didn't	
4820	objGord	But everyone tried	
4821	objGord	And everyone cared	
4822	objGord	And that is what Wandersong's about	
4823	objGord	Everybody trying	
4824	objGord	Everybody caring	
4825	objGord	And making something beautiful together	
4826	objGord	Even if it's not something you don't think you're good at.	
4827	objGord	(And everyone that said "my voice is terrible" in the choir was flat out WRONG)	
4828	objGord	The same week I started working on that song	
4829	objGord	My wife & I found out we were having a baby.	
4830	objGord	I don't know when you're reading this	
4831	objGord	We're due March 4,| 2019,| so we may or may not have had it yet.	
4832	objGord	I really hope it goes OK!	
4833	objGord	& hey you're here!	
4834	objGord	& I'm here	
4835	objGord	We made it.	
4836	objGord	We're just people that made this game.	
4837	objGord	You can do cool stuff too.	
4838	objGord	Just try	
4839	objGord	And care	
4840	objGord	See ya!

4842	objGreg	Hey,| I'm Greg.	
4843	objGreg	I made this game!	
4844	objGreg	It's really great to meet you!	
4845	objGreg	Did you really figure out how to get here yourself?	
4846	objGreg	Did you look it up on the internet?	
4847	objGreg	It's OK if you did.	
4848	objGreg	Either way,| I have a lot to say to you.	
4849	objGreg	I'm really touched that you came this far.	
4850	objGreg	From the bottom of my heart...	
4851	objGreg	I want to say THANK YOU.	
4852	objGreg	THANK YOU for playing!!!	
4853	objGreg	This game means a lot to me.	
4854	objGreg	I put a lot of love,| thought and effort into it.	
4855	objGreg	And it's really special...	
4856	objGreg	To make something like that| and share it with someone.	
4857	objGreg	I genuinely hope you enjoyed it.	
4858	objGreg	As I'm writing this,| I have no idea...	
4859	objGreg	What will happen when the game comes out.	
4860	objGreg	I don't know how many people will ever play it...	
4861	objGreg	Or if anyone will ever even find this message.	
4862	objGreg	But if there's even one person who cares about the game...	
4863	objGreg	That makes it worth it,| to me.	
4864	objGreg	So,| I guess it's not just "Thanks for playing"...	
4865	objGreg	But|| thanks| for caring.	
4866	objGreg	I hope someday...	
4867	objGreg	You can make something too,| and share it.	
4868	objGreg	It's so important to express yourself.	
4869	objGreg	And the world needs to hear your voice!	
4870	objGreg	You can do it.	
4871	objGreg	You are special!	
4872	objGreg	And you deserve love.	
4873	objGreg	I really believe that.	
4874	objGreg	You can hang out here as long as you want.	
4875	objGreg	If you keep chatting with me,	
4876	objGreg	I'm gonna talk about what it was like making the game.	
4877	objGreg	If that's interesting to you at all!	
4878	objGreg	Before I started Wandersong,	
4879	objGreg	I lived on my bicycle for 5 months and rode across the USA.	
4880	objGreg	Along the way I met lots of people...	
4881	objGreg	And did something I didn't think I could!	
4882	objGreg	I was feeling really optimisitc about life and humanity.	
4883	objGreg	And I wanted to make a game to express that...	
4884	objGreg	The first thing I made was the rainbow music wheel.	
4885	objGreg	Just that,| floating in an empty void.	
4886	objGreg	I wanted to make a controller into a musical instrument,	
4887	objGreg	And make it feel as natural and fun as possible.	
4888	objGreg	When I saw it worked,| more ideas started coming to me...	
4889	objGreg	Then started pouring like a waterfall...	
4890	objGreg	It took me a while to nail down the story.	
4891	objGreg	I had a plot in mind for a while,| but it was missing something...	
4892	objGreg	Then I had an epiphany one day,	
4893	objGreg	And the idea of the Earthsong came to me.	
4894	objGreg	I remember crying a little bit when it did.	
4895	objGreg	That was the key to unlocking the shape of the story.	
4896	objGreg	My original plot idea became just Act 5.	
4897	objGreg	And the world of Wandersong started to take shape.	
4898	objGreg	Act 1 came together within a few months.	
4899	objGreg	I've made countless changes to it since then...	
4900	objGreg	But it was basically the same as now.	
4901	objGreg	My friends played it and thought it had potential.	
4902	objGreg	What I needed was sounds,| and music.	
4903	objGreg	I tried recording my voice to make all the sounds...	
4904	objGreg	And I wrote some songs too.	
4905	objGreg	But the game was asking for better than I could give it.	
4906	objGreg	Simply put,| I realized the audio had to be amazing.	
4907	objGreg	Which meant I needed money.	
4908	objGreg	So I put it on Kickstarter.	
4909	objGreg	The response on Kickstarter was really wonderful.	
4910	objGreg	Everyone was so enthusiastic!	
4911	objGreg	The game quickly had more fan art than anything else I'd done.	
4912	objGreg	There were many musicians asking to work with me.	
4913	objGreg	It felt very special...	
4914	objGreg	Even so,| I didn't know if I'd make it until the very end.	
4915	objGreg	And when I did...| it felt like a miracle.	
4916	objGreg	Every step of the way,	
4917	objGreg	I felt like I was doing something a little too big for myself.	
4918	objGreg	And then just narrowly making it.	
4919	objGreg	||It felt |powerful...	
4920	objGreg	I met Gordon through some friends.	
4921	objGreg	His music for Parkitect had a really good vibe...	
4922	objGreg	He really believed in Wandersong,| despite the modest funds and huge idea.	
4923	objGreg	And he was local!| So we could work closely together.	
4924	objGreg	After a long search,| I'd found my musician.	
4925	objGreg	Em was his first hiree,| and Wandersong was her first game.	
4926	objGreg	She brought so much enthusiasm into the game...	
4927	objGreg	It bowled me over.	
4928	objGreg	...	
4929	objGreg	So,| we got to work.	
4930	objGreg	We made the game almost perfectly sequentially,	
4931	objGreg	Act by act.	
4932	objGreg	I would rush ahead,| developing gameplay and writing scenes.	
4933	objGreg	Then Em would breathe life into the game with audio.	
4934	objGreg	Gord was busy at first with other commitments...	
4935	objGreg	But he did eventually catch up.	
4936	objGreg	It took almost 2 years to work to the ending of the game.	
4937	objGreg	And then more months of refining,| polishing and fixing.	
4938	objGreg	I could talk forever about this.	
4939	objGreg	It took over my entire life,| for 3 years...	
4940	objGreg	But I'm going to stop here for now.	
4941	objGreg	Thanks for listening.	
4942	objGreg	We went and added some commentary notes to scenes in the game.	
4943	objGreg	Look out for those if you want to learn more!	
4944	objGreg	And...	
4945	objGreg	{size 2}THANKS FOR PLAYING	
4946	objGreg	{}It really means so much to me.	
4947	objGreg	More than I can put into words.

4950	objGuppy	Ah.|| Hello.	
4951	objGuppy	You've come just in time...	
4952	objGuppy	For The End.	
4953	objGuppy	We've all gathered here to bear witness.	
4954	objGuppy	It's a very special time for us fairies.	
4955	objGuppy	And| for the universe.	
4956	objGuppy	It's sad...	
4957	objGuppy	But perhaps not| too sad...	
4958	objGuppy	Everything must come to an end at some point.	
			
4959	objGuppy	Hello.	
4960	objGuppy	You may think I'm just a lowly fish.	
4961	objGuppy	But I am|| in fact|| also a key.	
4962	objGuppy	If you see me floating about...	
4963	objGuppy	Please bring me along to locked doors.	
4964	objGuppy	You'll find I'm much more handy than the average fish.	
4965	objGuppy	If I can ask...	
4966	objGuppy	Are you here to meet| Queen Chaos?	
4967	objBard	...Is|| that the Overseer?	
4968	objGuppy	Yes.	
4969	objBard	She has a really cool name!	
4970	objGuppy	I'm her little helper,| so to speak.	
4971	objGuppy	But she's been acting very odd of late.	
4972	objBard	Every Overseer I've met has been acting weird!	
4973	objGuppy	Hmmm...	
4974	objGuppy	Have you wondered...	
4975	objGuppy	Why the Overseers are acting strangely?	
4976	objBard	Aren't they supposed to?	
4977	objGuppy	No.	
4978	objGuppy	Something is very wrong...	
4979	objGuppy	It's a sign| of the end times.	
4980	objBard	Oh!	
4981	objBard	That sounds bad.	
4982	objGuppy	...	
4983	objGuppy	The Overseers are born as perfect beings.	
4984	objGuppy	They embody the natural forces that sustain our world.	
4985	objGuppy	But|| as the universe grows old...	
4986	objGuppy	They grow unhappy...|| lose their way...	
4987	objGuppy	Their corruption slowly spreads,	
4988	objGuppy	And so the world begins disintegrating as well.	
4989	objBard	Hmm...| sounds pretty bad!	
4990	objGuppy	...	
4991	objGuppy	{size 1.2}So|| tell me...	
4992	objGuppy	Are you here|| to complete {wiggle .5}The Ritual{/wiggle}?	
4993	objBard	?	
4994	objBard	I don't know what that is...	
4995	objGuppy	...

4997	objGuppy	Oh.	
4998	objGuppy	|||I see.

5002	objGuppy	{size 1.2}Queen Chaos may prove hard to deal with.	
5003	objGuppy	But|| just follow her rules...	
5004	objGuppy	And treat her politely...	
5005	objGuppy	And she will do what you ask.	
5006	objGuppy	{size 1.2}You've come so far with my help.	
5007	objGuppy	I hope I was able to prove...	
5008	objGuppy	That I truly am more handy than the average fish.

5022	objHala	Yes,| well,

5028	objHala	But,| I can help you,|| too.	
5030	objHala	The Queen.	
5031	objHala	You need to speak with her,| right?	
5032	objHala	That's|| my mom.	
5033	objHala	I need to talk to her too.	
5034	objHala	Before the invasion tomorrow...	
5037	objHala	But| it won't be easy to get to her.	
5038	objHala	Mohabumi is a place for magical people.

5040	objBard	Nope...	
5041	objHala	Right...	
5042	objHala	But if we work together,	
5043	objHala	I think we can figure something out.	
5044	objBard	I like teamwork!	
5045	objHala	It's a bit new to me.	
5046	objHala	But,| so is being dead...	
5047	objHala	And I guess it hasn't stopped me yet.	
5048	objHala	Sorry,|| for,| um...	
5049	objHala	Invading your body...	
5050	objHala	And then being trapped inside it...	
5051	objHala	That was pretty rude.	
5052	objHala	And you've already done so much for me.	
5053	objHala	I realize I'm asking|| a lot...	
5054	objBard	{}It's cool!	
5055	objBard	{}It sounds like we need your help,| too!	
5056	objHala	Guess so.

5064	objHala	You can see me,| right?	
5066	objHala	I think I can talk through reflections...	
5067	objHala	So that's handy.	
5068	objHala	If you want to meet the Queen...	
5069	objHala	I have an idea of where to start.	
5070	objHala	My sister is a student near here.

5284	objHero	What're you gonna do?| {shake .5}SING{/shake} to him?	
5285	objBard	Maybe!	
5287	objHero	That's ridiculous!	
5288	objHeartfairy	That might work!!!	
5289	objHeartfairy	The King of Hearts| really likes music!!!	
5290	objHeartfairy	If there's any bit of him left...	
5291	objHeartfairy	And you put |{wiggle}allllll{/wiggle}| your Heart into it...|!!!	
5292	objHeartfairy	He might respond to it!!!	
5293	objHeartfairy	It's worth a shot!!!	
5294	objBard	Yes!!!	
5295	objBard	See,| Audrey!	
5296	objBard	We have to try!

5302	objHero	Maybe...	
5303	objHero	Maybe,| it can work after all.	
5304	objHero	That would be nice...	
5305	objHeartfairy	Bark!!!	
5306	objHeartfairy	You give me a good feeling!!!	
5307	objHeartfairy	Are you| the Hero???	
5308	objBard	Oh,| nope!	
5309	objBard	That's Audrey!	
5310	objBard	But do you really think...

5312	objHeartfairy	Yes!!!	
5313	objHeartfairy	I like you!!!	
5314	objBard	Wow!	
5315	objBard	I like you too!!!

5320	objHeartfairy	He loves everybody and he would never hurt anybody!!!

5322	objHeartfairy	Why did he have to start acting so strange???	
5323	objHeartfairy	Do you think he'll be ok???	
5324	objBard	I don't know!	
5325	objBard	|But...

5334	objHeartfairy	He loves to bark and play and howl...	
5335	objHeartfairy	And |{shake}NOT{/shake}| make evil monsters!!!	
5336	objHeartfairy	(Even though that's what he does now!!!)	
5337	objHeartfairy	If you can make him normal again...

5342	objHero	We need to get a move on!	
5343	objBard	(Well...|| bye!)	
5344	objHeartfairy	(Bye!!!)	
			
5352	objHermes	What's even the point of magic?	
5353	objHermes	I'd trade it in a heartbeat...	
5354	objHermes	If it gave me my girlfriend back.	
5355	objHermes	Mm.| Probably.	
5356	objHermes	I suppose I'd have to think about it.	
5357	objHermes	When my girlfriend dumped me...	
5358	objHermes	Where was magic to help me THEN?	
5359	objHermes	That's what I'm asking.	
5360	objHermes	I can fly and walk on walls...	
5361	objHermes	But,| women?|| I just can't understand them.	
5362	objHermes	You know,| being a witch doesn't make life easy.	
5363	objHermes	I think about this all the time.	
5364	objHermes	People think magic solves all your problems.	
5365	objHermes	But I have lots of problems.	
5366	objHermes	I wish it solved all my problems.	
			
5367	objHero	Alright,| flunkies!	
5368	objHero	Excited?	
5369	objHero	Just keep behind me.	
			
5370	objBard	Gah!!	
5371	objMiriam	Hey!	
5372	objMiriam	Keep it together...	
5373	objMiriam	We're almost there.	
			
5374	objHero	...	
5375	objHero	Do you really think singing is going to do anything?	
5376	objBard	Yes!	
5377	objBard	It|| has to!	
5378	objHero	...	
5379	objHero	I hope you're right.	
5380	objHero	For both our sakes.	
5381	objHero	Remember the Sun and Moon Overseers?	
5382	objHero	When Overseers are dying,| they lose their personality...	
5383	objHero	And their shape...	
5384	objHero	By the end,| there's nothing left that's recognizable.	
5385	objHero	So,| even if the King of Hearts used to love music...	
5386	objHero	There's really no guarantee that part of him is still alive now.	
5387	objBard	Augh!|| No way!	
5388	objBard	Music...|| NEVER dies,| Audrey!	
5389	objBard	You'll see!	
5390	objHero	Hey,| hang on a second...	
5391	objHero	Where's...|| your witchy friend?	
5392	objBard	Oh,| Miriam?	
5393	objBard	You...| hurt her.	
5394	objBard	Remember?	
5395	objHero	Oh.	
5396	objHero	Well,| you and her really messed up back then.	
5397	objHero	Letting creatures out of the spirit world.	
5399	objHero	And she was a real jerk too.	
5400	objHero	But you|| aren't so bad.	
5401	objHero	I'm amazed you let her hang around you.	
5402	objHero	Her attitude was so bad,| she must have been a constant downer...	
5403	objBard	Hey.	
5404	objBard	...	
5405	objBard	Don't talk about Miriam like that.	
5406	objBard	She's my friend.	
5407	objBard	And...	
5408	objBard	I'm still mad that you hurt her.	
5409	objBard	I |{shake}HATE{/shake}|| that you call yourself a hero!	
5410	objBard	You just act like a big bully!	
5411	objBard	When you have a problem...	
5412	objBard	All you do is hurt people.	
5413	objBard	You're no hero at all!	
5414	objBard	And what you did to Miriam...	
5415	objBard	Was|| really terrible!	
5416	objBard	She was just trying to help my friends.	
5417	objBard	She was gonna save the world with me!	
5418	objBard	She's a good person!	
5419	objBard	You didn't have to hurt her,| Audrey!	
5420	objBard	THAT...| was just plain evil!	
5421	objHero	...	
5422	objHero	...|||Sorry.	
5423	objHero	For hurting your friend.	
5424	objBard	...	
5425	objBard	You're sorry?	
5426	objHero	I'm|| doing my best.	
5427	objHero	To be the hero.	
5428	objHero	And do the right thing.	
5433	objHero	||Maybe I went too far.	
5434	objHero	Is she okay?	
5435	objBard	I don't know...	
5436	objHero	...	
5437	objBard	She had to go home.	
5438	objBard	But I think she'll be okay.	
5439	objBard	I just wish she was here...	
5440	objHero	...	
5441	objBard	The things you do with your sword...	
5442	objBard	Aren't always good.	
5443	objBard	I know you fought monsters and saved lots of people.	
5444	objBard	But|| you also hurt us,| a lot.	
5445	objBard	I think||| it's good that you lost it...	
5446	objBard	You don't need it to be a hero.	
5447	objBard	You'll see.	
5448	objBard	We'll work together!	
5449	objBard	And save the King of Hearts!	
5450	objHero	I hope you're right.	
5451	objHero	You've already surprised me...	
5452	objHero	So I guess at this point,	
5453	objHero	I'll believe anything.	
5454	objHero	I won't be much use without my sword anyway.	
5455	objHero	So,	
5456	objHero	As scary as it is...	
5457	objHero	My fate here rests in your hands.	
5458	objHero	...	
5459	objHero	{size .7}(What have I gotten myself into...)	
			
5460	objHero	I can't believe we're getting out of this.	
5461	objHero	When I realized my sword was gone...	
5462	objHero	||...I thought I was done for.	
5463	objHero	I feel naked without it.	
5464	objHero	Even if we get out of here...	
5465	objHero	I don't know what I'll do without my sword.	
5466	objHero	I hope it's still on top of the mountain.	
5467	objBard	What do you need it for anyway?	
5468	objBard	You're not killing Overseers anymore!	
5469	objHero	It's more than that.	
5470	objHero	It's the source of my powers!	
5471	objHero	Without it...|| I'm basically nothing.	
5472	objBard	Audrey...| that's not true!	
5473	objBard	Your sword isn't what makes you great!	
5474	objHero	Well,| my sword is what lets me shoot lightning.	
5475	objHero	I would say that's pretty great.	
5476	objBard	What were you like...	
5477	objBard	...|before you knew you were the Hero?	
5478	objHero	Before I was the Hero...	
5479	objHero	||Nobody cared about me.	
5480	objBard	NO|body?	
5481	objHero	Why would they?	
5482	objHero	I mean yeah,| I'm strong,| and smart,| and pretty...	
5483	objHero	But...|| lots of people are those things.	
5484	objHero	That's not what makes people care about you.	
5485	objBard	...	
5488	objHero	When I got the sword...	
5490	objHero	THAT'S| when they cared.	
5491	objHero	So,| Eyala tested you in a dream,| right?	
5492	objBard	Yeah!	
5493	objBard	Did she test you,| too?	
5494	objHero	Yeah.	
5495	objHero	When the end of the world is nigh...	
5496	objHero	I think everyone in the world has that dream.	
5497	objHero	That's how they find the Hero.	
5498	objBard	...|EVERYONE?	
5499	objHero	Everyone.	
5500	objHero	They're all told the world's ending,| too.	
5501	objHero	But most everyone forgets about it after.	
5502	objHero	Or pushes the knowledge to the back of their mind.	
5503	objHero	It's a hard thing to accept.	
5504	objHero	How did you become friends with the bugs,| anyway?	
5505	objBard	I was just very very careful!	
5506	objBard	Everyone steps on bugs without thinking...	
5507	objBard	Can you imagine how that feels?	
5508	objHero	What,| to step on bugs?	
5509	objBard	No!|| To be stepped on!	
5510	objHero	Sounds pretty painful.	
5511	objBard	Not just painful...	
5512	objBard	It's sad...|| when nobody even cares about you.	
5513	objBard	So I don't step on the bugs,| Audrey!	
5514	objHero	And just for that,| they're your friends?	
5516	objBard	Yup!	
5517	objBard	Caring about others goes a long way!	
5518	objHero	...	
5519	objHero	How could you care...	
5520	objHero	About something so insignificant...| like bugs?	
5521	objHero	How did you even know they would help you?	
5522	objBard	Huh?|| I didn't know they would help me!	
5523	objBard	That's not why I care about them,| Audrey.	
5524	objBard	I care about them because they're living things!	
5525	objBard	And even if they never did anything to help me at all...	
5526	objBard	They would still be worth caring about.	
5527	objHero	...	
5528	objHero	You're|| so...	
5529	objHero	...	
5530	objHero	|Simple.	
5531	objBard	Hmm.	
5532	objBard	I guess I am!	
5533	objHero	Let's go...

5555	objHero	{/shake}There's no way out.	
5556	objHero	...

5559	objHero	...	
5560	objHero	{shake}I||{/shake} might really die here...	
5561	objHero	The Hero.	
5562	objBard	You can't do... ||{wiggle}anything?{/wiggle}	
5563	objHero	Not without my sword.	
5564	objBard	Oh!	
5565	objBard	What about|| the rainbow girl?	
5566	objHero	|Who?	
5567	objBard	The rainbow girl!	
5568	objBard	You know...| The messenger of Eya!	
5569	objHero	You mean Eyala?	
5570	objBard	{shake}SHE HAS A NAME?!	
5571	objHero	{}...	
5572	objHero	She's not coming to help.	
5573	objHero	Back in Chaandesh...	
5574	objHero	I told her to leave.	
5575	objHero	||...and never come back.	
5576	objBard	Why did you do that?	
5577	objHero	...	
5578	objHero	...	
5579	objHero	...|She...	
5580	objHero	...|{wiggle}bothered me.{/wiggle}	
5592	objHero	She's manipulative.	
5594	objHero	She's |{wiggle}supposed{/wiggle}| to be my guide...	
5595	objHero	But she just told me what to do!	
5596	objHero	Without letting me think for myself.	
5598	objHero	Like she knows better!	
5599	objHero	Last I checked,| I'm the Hero,| not her.	
5616	objHero	A real hero| shouldn't be bossed around all the time!	
5617	objHero	If you just follow what everyone says...	
5618	objHero	Then you never decide anything for yourself.	
5619	objHero	It's demeaning!	
5620	objHero	You probably wouldn't understand.	
5621	objHero	Eyala didn't either.	
5622	objHero	She'd just tell me what to do.|| Where to go.	
5623	objHero	But I'm not her puppet.	
5624	objHero	It's my job to save the world.	
5627	objHero	So I got rid of her.	
5628	objBard	She bothers me too!	
5629	objBard	She told me ||{wiggle}I{/wiggle}| could save the world...	
5631	objBard	By meeting all the Overseers,	
5632	objBard	And singing the Earthsong.	
5640	objBard	And that I was special,| and she believed in me.	
5642	objBard	But it doesn't feel like it at all.	
5643	objBard	The Overseers are dying so fast...	
5644	objBard	And no matter what I do, everything's getting worse.	
5648	objHero	When I asked about you,	
5649	objHero	She said...	
5650	objHero	{angel}"Don't worry about that lil bard!"	
5651	objHero	{angel}"The Earthsong is totally made up..."	
5652	objHero	{angel}"And it'll never ever work"	
5653	objHero	{angel}"You're the real Hero!"	
5656	objBard	{}She...| she said that?	
5658	objHero	I thought she said the same to you!	
5659	objHero	I had no idea why you kept trying...	
5660	objHero	Guess it makes sense now.	
5661	objHero	She just||| lied to you.	
5662	objBard	No...	
5663	objBard	She told us|| different things.	
5664	objBard	Maybe she lied to |{wiggle}you!{/wiggle}	
5665	objBard	Or maybe to both of us!	
5666	objHero	||She would never lie to me!	
5667	objHero	I'm|| the Hero!	
5669	objHero	She just told |{wiggle}you{/wiggle}|| what you wanted to hear.	
5670	objBard	...	
5671	objHero	...	
5672	objHero	So...	
5673	objHero	She told you...	
5675	objHero	You're |{wiggle}not{/wiggle}| the Hero?	
5676	objBard	Yeah...	
5677	objBard	She tested me,	
5678	objBard	With your sword,| I think.	
5679	objBard	But I couldn't use it...	
5680	objHero	Oh.	
5681	objBard	You must be really special...	
5682	objBard	To be able to use it...	
5683	objBard	I think...	
5684	objBard	It|| kinda makes me...	
5685	objBard	||Jealous.	
5686	objHero	Really?	
5687	objBard	I'm |really scared...	
5688	objBard	About the world ending...	
5689	objBard	I wish I could do anything to stop it...	
5690	objBard	I want to make a difference.	
5691	objBard	But I'm so small...	
5692	objBard	And unimportant...	
5693	objBard	You|| can change things.	
5694	objBard	You can make things happen.	
5695	objBard	But you're using your power...	
5696	objBard	To kill Overseers...	
5698	objBard	I don't want to give up on the world...	
5700	objBard	It feels wrong to end everything.	
5702	objBard	I wish|| it was |my| choice.	
5703	objHero	Well,| that's a relief.	
5704	objBard	||Huh?	
5705	objHero	With all of Eyala's lies...	
5706	objHero	I thought for a second that...	
5707	objHero	Well,| it's ridiculous,|| but...	
5709	objHero	She made me think...|| I might not actually be the Hero.	
5710	objHero	Before this all started,	
5711	objHero	I felt like you do.	
5712	objHero	Small,|| weak...	
5713	objHero	|||{wiggle}Normal.{/wiggle}	
5714	objHero	Being the Hero isn't easy!

5721	objBard	Don't you have anything to say about that?	
5723	objBard	Making the world end?

5725	objHero	Well,| I don't know!	
5726	objHero	It's|| the way it works...	
5728	objBard	How do you know that's how it works?	
5729	objBard	You said yourself that Eyala told lies...	
5730	objBard	What if that was one of them?	
5731	objBard	...	
5732	objHero	...	
5733	objHero	...	
5734	objHero	I know it.|| Because...	
5735	objHero	I'm|| the hero...	
5739	objBard	But what if it's made up?	
5740	objBard	You said you were worried you weren't the Hero.	
5741	objHero	You didn't let me finish.	
5742	objBard	But what if you aren't?	
5743	objHero	I am.	
5744	objHero	I can use the sword| and you can't.	
5745	objHero	That's how it is.	
5746	objBard	Why does using the sword make you a hero?	
5747	objHero	Be{shake}|CAUSE| {quake}{shake 1.2}THAT'S{shake}|| HOW IT |{shake 1.2}{quake}WORKS!{/shake}	
5748	objHero	Heh!|| Look...| whatever.	
5749	objHero	I don't care if you think I'm the Hero or not.	
5750	objHero	It's totally inconsequential.	
5751	objHero	Okay?	
5752	objHero	It doesn't change anything about our situation.	
5753	objBard	...	
5754	objBard	We're really trapped,| huh?	
5755	objHero	Yeah.	
5756	objBard	...	
5757	objHero	...	
5758	objBard	...	
5759	objHero	...	
5760	objHero	...Alright.	
5761	objHero	You really want to know the truth?	
5762	objHero	I ||{shake .5}am{/shake}| scared.	
5763	objHero	About ending the world.	
5764	objHero	A little bit.	
5765	objHero	But...|| that's what the Hero is supposed to do!	
5766	objHero	I can't let my little fears control me.	
5767	objHero	Even if,| sometimes,|| it means...	
5770	objHero	|||Pretending.	
5775	objHero	I couldn't say that to Eyala.	
5776	objHero	Because then she'd think I wasn't the Hero.	
5777	objHero	What if she changed her mind?| Took back my sword?

6259	objJaime	Dorky...	
6260	objJaime	I'm working on launching my solo career.	
6261	objJaime	The music I do is pretty different...	
6262	objJaime	But...|| I need these gigs.	
6263	objJaime	Girls love a guy in a band.	
6264	objJaime	After I perform,| they line up...	
6265	objJaime	Well...|| except with this band...	
6266	objJaime	It's hard to look cool with these dweebs behind you.	
6267	objJaime	But I'm doing my best.	
6268	objJaime	Are you their old singer?	
6269	objJaime	That explains a lot...	
6270	objJaime	They always talk about you.	
6271	objJaime	And whenever I sing...	
6272	objJaime	They want me to sound more like you.	
6273	objJaime	Can you give me a sample?	
6274	objJaime	Sing for me.	
6275	objJaime	Oh...	
6276	objJaime	That...|| Uh.

6278	objJasmine	My great great grandma started the whole war with Rulle.	
6279	objJasmine	It's true!|| Really.	
6280	objJasmine	A long long time ago,| she was in Xiatian,	
6281	objJasmine	And she saw one of those animals...	
6282	objJasmine	What do they call them?|| Kwin?	
6283	objJasmine	It was a beautiful |||bird,| I think.	
6284	objJasmine	And she decided to keep it!	
6285	objJasmine	But later she found out it was the prince's Kwin!	
6286	objJasmine	When it went missing,| he panicked.	
6287	objJasmine	They thought it was kidnapped by spies...	
6288	objJasmine	Yep.|| So they started the war over it.	
6289	objJasmine	You know,| it was crazy,	
6290	objJasmine	Because the Qwin liked my great great grandma way better.	
6291	objJasmine	The prince was,| like...|| really mean to it.	
6292	objJasmine	It was embarrasing for Rulle.	
6293	objJasmine	So they kept the real reason for the war a secret.	
6294	objJasmine	But it was my great great grandma.|| Yup.	
6295	objJasmine	Rest in peace...	
6296	objJasmine	My whole family is crazy.	
6297	objJasmine	We used to live in the Mohabumi castle.|| Yup.	
6298	objJasmine	When I was a kid,| it was my job to brush the Queen's hair.	
6299	objJasmine	I had to do it every day!|| Even though I was so young.	
6300	objJasmine	My dad was like,|| a political advisor to her.	
6301	objJasmine	So he knew,| like,|| all her secrets.	
6302	objJasmine	But he knew too much...|| Yup.	
6303	objJasmine	One day he found out something he wasn't supposed to.	
6304	objJasmine	So the Queen killed him!	
6305	objJasmine	Yeah...|| it was so sad.	
6306	objJasmine	We had to leave the castle forever.	
6307	objJasmine	I never found out the secret that got him killed.	
6308	objJasmine	But,	
6309	objJasmine	I think it was about|| one of the princesses...	
6310	objJasmine	Yup.	
6311	objJasmine	They're always doing illegal stuff.	
6312	objJasmine	They can get away with anything,| because they're royalty.	
6313	objJasmine	When I was young,| everyone said I was a prodigy.	
6314	objJasmine	Like with magic.	
6315	objJasmine	I studied in the castle with the princesses.	
6316	objJasmine	They were all jealous of me though. |Because I was so talented.	
6317	objJasmine	I tried for the Academy when I was still a kid.	
6319	objJasmine	Took the entrance exam and everything.	
6320	objJasmine	The proctor told me my exam was flawless too,| when I handed it in.	
6321	objJasmine	But then later,| when I got the official results,	
6322	objJasmine	My score was terrible.	
6323	objJasmine	But then I looked at the answers on my exam...	
6324	objJasmine	And it wasn't even my handwriting!	
6325	objJasmine	They switched my exam...| on purpose.|| Yup.	
6326	objJasmine	It was totally corrupt.	
6327	objJasmine	The Queen bought my score for one of the princesses.	
6328	objJasmine	I guess she wasn't too smart either.	
6329	objJasmine	Based on her exam.	
6330	objJasmine	So I never got into the Academy.	
6331	objJasmine	Crazy,| huh?

6381	objJordan	I'm worried for my grandaughter and her qin...	
6382	objJordan	They was supposed to go back to Xiatian.	
6383	objJordan	Until the monsters showed up.	
6384	objJordan	How much longer are we gonna be trapped here?	
6385	objJordan	This ain't no place for a girl to grow up.	
6386	objJordan	Must be nice to be able to fly.	
6387	objJordan	Just come and go,| while we're stuck.	
6388	objJordan	Witches got it all.	
6389	objJordan	If you're seein' the king,

6398	objJuan	Nobody knows where she is now.	
6399	objJuan	She vanished!

6454	objKamala	Y'know,| the whole universe...	
6455	objKamala	It's just all of us in one big mushy pile together.

6458	objKamala	I like thinking about that!

6461	objKenneth	Welcome,| pilgrim...	
6462	objKenneth	I'm sure you've noticed how...	
6463	objKenneth	Quiet...|| it is,| here.	
6464	objKenneth	The heart of the mountain has changed...	
6465	objKenneth	A dark |{glitch .1}Beast stalks its slopes...	
6466	objKenneth	The people who once lived here have evacuated.	
6467	objKenneth	Only we monks remain now.	
6468	objKenneth	At first,| the monsters were many...	
6469	objKenneth	They came down from the mountain peak...	
6470	objKenneth	Destructive,| hungry things...	
6471	objKenneth	We tried to hide everyone here in the temple...	
6472	objKenneth	But after the monsters spread away from the mountain,	
6473	objKenneth	The |{glitch .1}Beast came next...	
6474	objKenneth	Its presence is...|| terrifying,| pilgrim.	
6475	objKenneth	It is empty...|| utterly devoid of life or personality...	
6476	objKenneth	A dark harbinger of |{glitch .1}The End.	
6477	objKenneth	Nobody is safe here anymore.	
6478	objKenneth	You are welcome to stay in the temple with us...	
6479	objKenneth	But...|| you should consider leaving this place entirely.	
6480	objBard	Um!...	
6481	objBard	Actually,| I came to climb the mountain!	
6482	objBard	I have to visit the Overseer here...	
6483	objKenneth	...	
6484	objKenneth	Pilgrim...	
6485	objKenneth	You| must| reconsider...	
6486	objKenneth	Nobody has communed with the Overseer in our lifetimes...	
6487	objKenneth	They have long since abandoned us.	
6488	objBard	They're just sick!	
6489	objBard	All the Overseers are getting messed up...	
6490	objBard	That's why this stuff is happening.	
6491	objBard	But I'm gonna fix it!	
6492	objBard	I'm learning the Earthsong!	
6493	objKenneth	You seem so sure...	
6494	objKenneth	I do not know what this |"Earthsong"| is...	
6495	objKenneth	But I will not stop you from carrying out your will.	
6496	objKenneth	If this truly is |{glitch .1}The End||...	
6497	objKenneth	It may not much matter what you do anyway...	
6498	objKenneth	Is anywhere safe anymore?	
6499	objKenneth	We are cut off from the rest of the world here...	
6500	objBard	I've definitely seen monsters...	
6501	objBard	But I don't know if they're |{wiggle}everywhere{/wiggle}!	
6502	objKenneth	I fear|| {glitch .1}The End| is coming soon...	
6503	objKenneth	And there is no escaping it...	
6504	objKenneth	Use this time wisely,| pilgrim.	
			
6505	objKenneth	Oh...	
6506	objKenneth	You...	
6507	objKenneth	What brings you here,| pilgrim?	
6508	objKenneth	This place is not safe...	
6509	objKenneth	Please,|| come inside with me.	
			
6510	objKing	It feels so bizarre,	
6511	objKing	Sitting here and talking to the witch-queen...	
6512	objKing	Like she's just another person.	
6513	objKing	We spent our whole lives afraid of you...	
6514	objQueen	{fade}Get over it.	
6515	objQueen	I'm not going to live forever...	
6516	objQueen	We don't have time for distrust.	
6517	objQueen	I need to know my people will have peace after I'm gone.	
6518	objQueen	{fade}The Sky Temple was destroyed in the monster outbreak.	
6519	objQueen	It's too important a place to leave like that...	
6520	objQueen	Are you going to rebuild it?	
6521	objKing	{}Uh...|| I thought |you| people wanted the Temple...	
6522	objQueen	{fade}I thought |YOU| did!	
6523	objKing	{}...	
6524	objKing	Well,| we did...	
6525	objKing	{size .75}Until it got busted...	
6526	objKing	{}Maybe|| we should...	
6527	objQueen	{fade}Rebuild it together.	
6528	objKing	{}Yeah.	
6529	objKing	Like a symbol of our truce.	
6530	objQueen	{fade}That's a splendid idea.	
6531	objKing	It's hard knowing what to ask for here.	
6532	objKing	All we ever really wanted from you...	
6533	objKing	Was...|| to be left alone,| I guess.	
6534	objQueen	{fade}Leaving alone is what got us into this mess.	
6535	objQueen	Where our communication died,| distrust grew...	
6536	objQueen	Until we lost all concept of your true intentions.	
6539	objQueen	{fade}We need the promise that we won't be alone anymore.	
6540	objQueen	We are here together,| and that isn't about to change.	
6541	objQueen	So if we are to coexist peacefully...	
6542	objQueen	We need to work together.	
			
6543	objKing	...	
6544	objKing	Yeah,| so...	
6545	objKing	Uh...	
6546	objKing	Sorry I threw you in jail...	
6547	objKing	Wait,| no I'm not.	
6548	objKing	You were really rude that one time.	
6549	objKing	This is all a huge relief.	
6550	objKing	Well...|| kind of...	
6551	objKing	We aren't fighting Chaandesh...|| for now...	
6552	objKing	But now there are giant monsters everywhere...	
6553	objKing	We're not really better off...	
6554	objKing	I always knew you were probably good...	
6555	objKing	My qin seems really relaxed around you.	
6556	objKing	Just kidding...	
6557	objKing	He's always relaxed...	
6558	objKing	He's just a big furry lump.

6574	objLee	{size .7}{shake .5}Your majesty!!!|| That was still supposed to be secret!	
6575	objKing	{}Oh.	
6576	objKing	{}Whoof.	
6577	objKing	See,| this is why I can't talk to outsiders anymore.	
6578	objKing	Too many secrets to keep track of.	
6579	objKing	Secrets for days.	
6580	objKing	Hey,| uh...	
6581	objKing	Is your buddy...| okay...?	
6582	objBard	{halasing}King of Rulle, it is time to talk	
6583	objBard	Your war is tear|ing us a|part	
6584	objBard	I come to you_a prin|cess	
6585	objBard	with an o|pen heart	
6586	objBard	to beg the end of what you want to start...	
6587	objBard	Give peace a chance	
6588	objBard	End this foolish dance	
6589	objBard	You've caused such pain and such hate	
6590	objBard	and you've sown a dark fate	
6591	objBard	with your fear and your blind arr|o|gance!	
			
6592	objLan	I like the Hero!	
6593	objLan	She's so|| cool...	
6594	objLan	She's like the coolest,| strongest girl in the whole world...	
6595	objLan	|||{wiggle}Wow...{/wiggle}	
6596	objLan	And I hear she's staying in Xiatian,| at the lodge...	
6597	objLan	Like a normal person...|| so humble!	
			
6598	objLan	The butterflies in Xiatian are so nice...	
6599	objLan	If you sing,| they follow you around!	
6600	objLan	But they get bored fast if you stop...	
6601	objLan	If you can bring 5 to this tree...	
6602	objLan	I think something special would happen!	
6603	objLan	I think the butterflies really like the red leaves here...	
6604	objLan	I wonder if they taste good to them?	
6605	objLan	I tried sucking on one...|| but it was gross.	
6606	objLan	Have you tried singing to the butterflies?	
6607	objLan	There's 5 around here...	
			
6608	objLan	Wow!|| You're like...| a master of the butterflies...	
6609	objLan	Can you talk to them too?	
6610	objLan	Please tell them Lan says hi!	
6611	objLan	I like to sing to the butterflies...	
6612	objLan	When I'm alone at night,	
6613	objLan	I sing out the window so they come to me...	
6614	objLan	There's a couple of the same ones that come every night.	
6615	objLan	I think they're a little family!	
6616	objLan	My little butterfly friends...	
6617	objLan	They're like my second qin...	
6618	objLan	Oh!|| But they'll never replace you,| Lucia!	
6619	objLan	I named my butterfly family Suki and Tengen,| by the way.	
6620	objLan	I thought they should have regular people names.	
6621	objLan	If I gave them cute buggy names,| they might think I was making fun of them...	
6622	objLan	But they're adult bugs with a family,| so they need adult names.	
			
6623	objLapti	Hoody-hoo!	
6624	objLapti	Do you like the garden?	
6625	objLapti	My qin and I put our hearts into raising these plants for the castle.	
6626	objLapti	They're like our little babies...	
6627	objLapti	You can almost hear them singing in the sun.	
6628	objLapti	The most amazing thing happened to me the other day.	
6629	objLapti	I have this table at home,| but it has a strange shape...	
6630	objLapti	It left a bothersome gap to the wall no matter how I angled it.	
6631	objLapti	But I found a stray piece of wood here...	
6632	objLapti	And it perfectly covered the gap my table makes!	
6633	objLapti	That's destiny.	
6634	objLapti	Sometimes life can be so good to you.	
6635	objLapti	Tending a garden in an arid region can be quite challenging.	
6636	objLapti	Most people who visit don't consider how much work it takes.	
6637	objLapti	But it's so rewarding,| too.	
6638	objLapti	The pretty colors bring light to everyone's day...	
6639	objLapti	And they honor our great King,| too.	
6640	objLapti	May his wisdom keep us safe from the war...

6656	objHero	The honor is all mine!	
6657	objHero	But,| you know...	
6658	objHero	What I'm |NOT| honored by...	
6659	objHero	Is the attendence...	
6660	objHero	Of these |{wiggle}criminals!{}	
6661	objProfessor	{wiggle}Criminals?{}	
6662	objHero	Yes,| I'm afraid so!	
6663	objHero	{size .8}These rogues broke through Rulle's border...	
6664	objHero	{size .7}Cheated their way into the King's court...	
6665	objHero	{size .6}And made a getaway from prison to here!	
6666	objHero	{size .8}They're fugitives from Rulle!

6672	objProfessor	The scoundrels who took our beloved princess!	
6673	objBard	Wha???	
6674	objEduard	And ended her poor life...	
6675	objEduard	An enemy of those villains is surely our friend.	
6676	objBard	I didn't know that!	
6677	objMiriam	{size .6}Guess that |{wiggle}would{/wiggle}| explain some things.	
6678	objMiriam	Like how we found her...	
6679	objBard	{size .8}But why would they do that??	
6680	objDeva	Don't you know?	
6681	objDeva	The people of Rulle |{wiggle}hate{/wiggle}| Chaandesh....	
6682	objDeva	They'd do anything to get at us...	
6683	objLayla	Oh!| Miss hero!	
6684	objLayla	||She must have retired for the evening...	
6686	objEduard	It certainly is getting late.

6689	objEduard	Take it easy,| and enjoy themselves tonight.	
			
6690	objLayla	Why hello!	
6691	objLayla	Welcome to Mohabumi!	
6692	objLayla	The band has all dispersed now...	
6693	objLayla	But we really were big fans of your composition!	
6694	objLayla	Perhaps we'll save it for future shows!| Hee!	
6695	objLayla	Not to worry!	
6696	objLayla	Rulle won't be able to reach you here.	
6697	objLayla	Mohabumi is like a huge fortress!	
6698	objLayla	Although,| hmm...	
6699	objLayla	You can't use magic,| can you?	
6700	objLayla	You'll have a hard time getting around town on foot...	
6701	objLayla	I'm a complete fool for these shops!	
6702	objLayla	Every time I come I feel I have to purchase something.	
6703	objLayla	Or two,| or three,| or four things...	
6704	objLayla	Mostly these shops are tourist traps for visitors,| of course...	
6705	objLayla	The classier places are higher up in the city...	
6706	objLayla	But| they're just so colorful and lovely!	
6707	objLayla	I suppose I really am easy,| hee!	
			
6708	objLayla	{wiggle}Hmmmm...{}	
6709	objLayla	Oh,|| hello...	
6711	objLayla	I do apologize if I seem distracted...	
6712	objLayla	I'm in a bit of a pickle,| you see.	
6713	objLayla	I'm in charge of the musical entertainment this evening...	
6714	objLayla	But I forgot a most crucial element.	
6715	objLayla	|||...||music...	
6716	objLayla	The band has no score to play!	
6717	objBard	Oh!	
6721	objLayla	Yes,| yes...	
6722	objLayla	They're all preparing in their quarters now...	
6723	objLayla	But they must be as bamboozled as I am!	
6724	objLayla	{wiggle}Hmmmm...{}	
6725	objLayla	{size .7}Well,|| we could...	
6726	objLayla	No no,| not that...	
6727	objLayla	But what if...	
6728	objLayla	Hmmmm...	
6729	objLayla	The only solution that comes to mind...	
6730	objLayla	Would be if we improvised a new score to play...?	
6731	objLayla	But,| oh...|| what a gamble...	
6732	objLayla	If only we had a composer on board...	
			
6733	objLayla	Well goodness me!	
6734	objLayla	Miraculously,| the band all has music to play!	
6735	objLayla	Won't you join us for the show,| then?	
6736	objBard	Not yet!	
6737	objBard	Let's go!	
6738	objLayla	Ready to watch our performance?	
6739	objBard	Not yet!	
6740	objBard	Oh yes!	
			
6741	objLayla	Well!|| Let me know when.	
6742	objLayla	Well,| alright!	
6743	objLayla	I haven't heard their new score yet.	
6744	objLayla	And goodness,| I'm excited...	
			
6745	objLee	It's you...	
6746	objLee	I promised myself,| if I ever saw you again,	
6747	objLee	I'd capture you and put you back in prison.	
6748	objLee	But now we're in peace negotiations...	
6749	objLee	So your counts of treason are currently suspended.	
6750	objLee	I suppose...	
			
6751	objLee	Hmph.	
6752	objLee	Maybe your little song did channel the voice of our people...	
6753	objLee	But...|| it didn't speak for me...	
6754	objLee	The witches are still a dangerous threat to us!	
6755	objLee	We cannot just ease our guard against them...	
6756	objBard	But they're just normal people!	
6757	objLee	Hmph.	
6758	objBard	Besides,| deep down in your heart...	
6759	objBard	Wouldn't it be better if you didn't fight?	
6760	objLee	No.	
6761	objBard	Really?	
6762	objLee	No.	
6763	objBard	{wiggle}Reeeaaaaally?{/wiggle}	
6764	objLee	No.	
6765	objBard	You sure?	
6766	objLee	No.	
6767	objBard	But-	
6768	objLee	No.	
6769	objBard	What if-	
6770	objLee	No.	
6771	objBard	How about-	
6772	objLee	No.	
6773	objBard	Even if-	
6774	objLee	No.

6780	objLee	Well...	
6781	objLee	Alright,| I see your point.	
6782	objLee	Maybe yes.	
6783	objLee	We have enough problems as it is!!!	
6784	objLee	This is a cruel world we live in...	
6785	objLee	Threats from every side...	
6786	objLee	We aren't prepared to deal with monsters like this.	
6787	objLee	You and your witch friend posed a huge threat to our kingdom.	
6788	objLee	How the Hero came to trust you is beyond me...	
6789	objLee	But...|| today,| you have helped us a great deal.	
6790	objLee	I suppose.	
6791	objLee	So I will not attempt to capture you...	
6792	objLee	And take you back to prison,	
6793	objLee	As I previously planned to.	
6794	objLee	Unless I ever see you again...	
6795	objLee	Farewell, ruffian.	
			
6796	objLee	{size 2}Hello.	
6797	objMiriam	{size 1}Uh...| hello

6799	objMiriam	Can you...| go get him... or something?	
6800	objLee	Absolutely||| {quake}{shake}NOT!!!{/shake}	
6801	objLee	In case you haven't noticed,| we are at war!	
6802	objLee	It's my |sole duty| to protect the King from harm...	
6803	objLee	So we are not allowing anyone in or out at this time.	
6804	objLee	Es|pecially| not |any witches...	
6805	objMiriam	{shake}what{/shake}	
6806	objMiriam	That's ridiculous!|| {shake}Nobody??{/shake}	
6807	objMiriam	What about you?| You don't go in or out?	
6808	objLee	Obviously we make some exceptions.	
6809	objLee	We've invited the Hero for a special visit...	
6810	objLee	But unless you are of her caliber...|| {shake}NO WAY{/shake}|, sister!	
6811	objMiriam	{shake}aaaaaaaaaaaaaa|rrrghhhh!!!{/shake}

6823	objLee	{}...

6825	objBard	We should go,| Miriam!	
6826	objMiriam	Yeah sure	
			
6827	objLee	Please feel free to enjoy the exquisite castle garden.	
			
6828	objMiriam	{shake}Gah!!!{/shake}	
6829	objMiriam	I can't believe this...	
6830	objBard	What do we do now?	
6831	objMiriam	{shake}UM.{/shake}	
6832	objMiriam	Well,| we could forget about your ghost message.	
6834	objBard	{quake}{shake}Nooo!||{/shake} We can't do that!	
6835	objBard	It could end the {wiggle}war{},| Miriam!	
6837	objBard	We can't quit yet!	
6838	objMiriam	Well...	
6839	objMiriam	Then we can talk to your good buddy,| The Hero!	
6840	objBard	{quake}{shake}NOOO!!||{/shake} Definitely not that either!!!	
6841	objMiriam	Those|| are the choices!	
6842	objMiriam	|I| think we should focus on finding the Overseer song.	
6843	objMiriam	But you do you!	
			
6844	objBard	Do you know anything about the musician staying here?	
6845	objLena	That's not a suspicious thing to ask at all.	
6846	objLena	They came into town just recently.	
6847	objLena	Pretty much just playing in their room nonstop.	
6848	objLena	No noise complaints from the neighbors,| though.	
6849	objLena	Guess they like it.	
6850	objLena	If I remember right,	
6851	objLena	They said they were visiting for a funeral.	
6852	objLena	Like,|| in that cemetery just outside town.	
6853	objLena	Hey.|| Welcome to the Delphi Inn.	
6854	objLena	Interested in a room?	
6855	objBard	|||No?	
6856	objLena	What else is new	
6857	objLena	I'm stuck with this place because it's a family business.	
6858	objLena	Nobody ever visits Delphi though.	
6859	objLena	Because nothing ever happens here.	
6860	objLena	Yeah,| this town used to be a lot more bustling.	
6861	objLena	It's been on the down for a while though.	
6862	objLena	Nobody here...|| {wiggle}cares{}| about anything||, anymore.	
6863	objBard	Why do you think the town got so sad?	
6864	objLena	I don't know||, why does anything ever happen?	
6865	objLena	The economy?	
			
6866	objLena	{wiggle}Ugh...{/wiggle}	
6867	objLena	Please don't talk to me about that Raven show.	
6868	objLena	I keep hearing it was so awesome and blah blah blah.	
6869	objLena	But |{wiggle}I{} ||{shake}missed{/shake}| it!	
6870	objLena	Because I was working this crudhole.	
6871	objLena	{wiggle}{shake}S|I|G|H.	
6872	objLena	It's lame that I missed it,| but the whole town seems happier.	
6873	objLena	Being around that renewed energy makes me feel better,| too.	
6874	objLena	Well,| if the Raven's doing more shows,| maybe I'll get more business.	
6875	objLena	Or||| something.	
			
6876	objLena	Whoa,| wait.	
6877	objLena	Are| {shake}YOU{}| the singer from the Raven?	
6878	objLena	Everyone keeps telling me your show was great.	
6879	objLena	Thanks for the little sample.	
6880	objLena	The way everyone talked,| I thought you were some kind of celebrity.	
6881	objLena	It's really cool that you took time to come sing to me.	
6882	objLena	Your voice is as interesting as they say.	
6883	objLena	I guess I feel a bit better that I got to hear it.	
			
6884	objLenny	What's the point?	
6885	objLenny	Why even bother?	
6886	objLenny	Who ever cares?	
			
6887	objLenny	Some days are really hard.	
6888	objLenny	But you never know when a really nice one is around the corner.	
6889	objLenny	Thanks for showing me that with your music.	
6890	objLenny	I don't want to be sad forever.	
6891	objLenny	But I guess only I have the power to change that.	
6892	objLenny	I'll make the best of every day.	
			
6893	objLighter	You look tired,| old friend.	
			
6894	objTanya	You met the lamplighter yet?	
6895	objTanya	He's such a star!	
6896	objTanya	Turns every light in the city on and off,| every sunset and sunrise...	
6897	objTanya	This guy keeps Chismest running!	
6898	objLighter	...

6913	objLin	You're not from around here, are you?	
6914	objLin	I hate to say it,| but...	
6915	objLin	Your clothes are...|| disgusting...	
6916	objLin	When's the last time you washed them?	
6917	objLin	Where on Earth have you been to wearing that?	
6918	objLin	My buddy Bo is military.	
6919	objLin	It's a pretty raw deal.	
6920	objLin	My dad has a lot of money,| so I'm lucky...	
6921	objLin	I don't have to enlist or anything.	
6922	objLin	I hope Bo can get out of it, somehow.	
6923	objLin	It's kinda hard being young these days.	
6924	objLin	You can make plans about what kind of job you wanna have...	
6925	objLin	But once you get to a certain age,	
6926	objLin	You might just get put into the war.	
6927	objLin	Then all those plans go out the window.	
6928	objLin	Not really hopeful.	
6929	objLin	I mean |{wiggle}I'm{/wiggle}| lucky,|| but...	
			
6930	objLoreman	Backstory is important,	
6931	objLoreman	But I want to take just this one moment to let you know:	
6932	objLoreman	Your show was great!	
6933	objLoreman	Someday I'll tell tales of it as backstory to some other story.	
6934	objLoreman	Hi,| my name's Nate.	
6935	objLoreman	I have some backstory to tell you!	
6936	objBard	No thanks!	
6937	objBard	Let's hear it!	
6938	objLoreman	Hmm,| you sure you don't want to hear backstory?	
6939	objLoreman	It'll really help you immerse yourself in the world.	
6940	objLoreman	It's really important to do that.	
6941	objLoreman	I know lots,| so talk to me if you want to hear some!	
6942	objLoreman	OK,|| here is some backstory!	
6943	objLoreman	This town is over 400 years old!	
6944	objLoreman	The girl who works for the Crazy Raven wants to be a dancer.	
6945	objLoreman	Apparently,|| everyone recently had the same| ominous dream.	
6946	objLoreman	The old explorers stopped here because of cave monsters.	
6947	objLoreman	The candy shop owner's son runs the Crazy Raven.	
6948	objLoreman	A famous band got its start here,| but they don't come back anymore.	
6949	objLoreman	When I was in high school,| everyone called me "Nate the Great".	
6950	objLoreman	The coffee beans here are supplied by pirates!	
6951	objLoreman	Somebody fierce came through town recently.	
6952	objLoreman	They were looking for the Overseer song!	
6953	objLoreman	But they didn't find it...	
6954	objLoreman	Well,|| thanks for listening.	
6955	objLoreman	I've always got more backstory if you want to hear it.	
6956	objLoreman	Wow.|| So...	
6957	objLoreman	You're a really big backstory fan,| huh?	
			
6958	objBard	...|Maybe I should try singing that again.	
			
6959	objLu	{wiggle}Sigh...{/wiggle}	
6960	objLu	All this stress is bad for my skin.	
6961	objLu	This forever-war would be boring...	
6962	objLu	If it wasn't also terrifying!	
6963	objLu	I don't want to be eaten by a monster...	
6964	objLu	I thought sideways living would be a fun change of pace.	
6965	objLu	After me and my boyfriend split...	
6966	objLu	It was time for something new.	
6967	objLu	Turns out it's not really that exciting.	
6968	objLu	My life is still the same boring thing.	
6969	objLu	But sideways now.	
6970	objLu	Building in Mohabumi is a pretty unique challenge.	
6971	objLu	That used to be my problem...	
6972	objLu	I was studying to be an architect.	
6973	objLu	Until I wasn't.	
6974	objLu	How does anyone know...	
6975	objLu	What they want to do?	
6976	objLu	I can't even decide which direction to live in.

7218	objManny	Delphi ain't really a thing anymore,| ace.	
7219	objManny	Delphi| really changed after you left...	
7225	objViola	There was a dark |feeling| in the air...	
7226	objClara	The sun didn't shine as bright.	
7227	objClara	The wind stopped blowing...	
7228	objViola	And monsters started appearing!	
7230	objBard	Monsters?	
7231	objClara	They were horrible.

7255	objManny	We carried that good vibe you gave us...

7258	objBard	Wow!	
7259	objManny	Delphi may be in some trouble...

7261	objManny	And there's still good folks there.	
7262	objViola	Yes!| Like that witch...	
7263	objBard	Witch?	
7264	objManny	Oh yeah.

7275	objClara	She's the only one who can fight the monsters...	
7276	objViola	She's impressive for an old lady!

7290	objMarkus	|||Yes.	
7291	objMarkus	And I'm very sorry about that.	
7292	objMarkus	But you see,

7294	objMarkus	What I'm saying is,| I'm poor.	
7295	objMarkus	But I understand you now have a very valuable jewel.	
7296	objMarkus	So you see,	
7297	objMarkus	I had no choice...	
7298	objMarkus	But to sneak onto your ship,

7304	objPeggy	{shake}What a jerk!!!

7316	objMiriam	{shake .5}Some dudes|| {quake}need to be blasted!!{/shake}	
7317	objBard	Just give me a chance!!	
			
7318	objMarkus	I have to say,|| I'm surprised at this gesture.	
7319	objMarkus	...	
7320	objMarkus	You aren't going to give me the jewel,| are you...	
7321	objBard	I really don't have it!	
7322	objMarkus	I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do.	
7323	objMarkus	How will I ever win back my wife...?	
7324	objMarkus	She left without saying anything...	
7325	objMarkus	I'm sure money was the reason she left...	
7326	objMarkus	As a man of the sea,| I'm no millionaire.	
7327	objMarkus	But the sea was my first love.| I can't give that up.	
7328	objBard	When was the last time you talked?	
7329	objMarkus	The last time we talked...	
7330	objMarkus	...	
7331	objMarkus	I||| said some things I regret.	
7332	objMarkus	...	
7333	objMarkus	That might be why she left.	
7334	objMarkus	...	
7335	objMarkus	I'm not sure what I'm doing here anymore.	
7336	objMarkus	I'm going to remove myself from the situation.

7338	objMarkus	Ah.|| You again.	
7339	objMarkus	...	
7340	objMarkus	I realize what a jerk I was.	
7341	objMarkus	I want to apologize for that.	
7342	objMarkus	I've had time to reflect on the past.	
7343	objMarkus	I regret that I was aggressive and out of control.	
7344	objMarkus	...I'm sure it's the real reason my wife left.	
7345	objMarkus	I know I don't deserve it...	
7346	objMarkus	But I hope we can put my past actions behind us.	
7347	objMarkus	I would rather be friends.	
			
7348	objMarkus	Ah!!!	
7349	objMarkus	Hey!

7356	objBard	Oh.	
7357	objMarkus	Watch it!!!	
7358	objMarkus	Don't you see...	
7359	objMarkus	Your violence will only beget more violence.	
7360	objMarkus	You cannot solve your problems with it!	
7361	objBard	But |{wiggle}you{}| were violent first!!!	
7363	objBard	You tied up my friends!	
7364	objMarkus	Ah.|| Yes.	
7365	objMarkus	I suppose you are right.	
7366	objMarkus	But,| you see...	
7367	objMarkus	I am much stronger than you.	
7368	objMarkus	So violence is a productive means for me.	
7369	objMarkus	Hrrrr!!!	
7370	objMarkus	I see you are not willing to back down...	
7371	objMarkus	From your violent measures against me.	
7372	objBard	Yeah!!!	
7373	objMarkus	So be it.	
7374	objMarkus	But it will not resolve this situation.	
7375	objBard	Yeah!!!| Take that!	
7376	objMarkus	...	
7377	objMarkus	...	
			
7378	objMarkus	...

7382	objBard	Nope, it's for me!	
7383	objBard	Yes!	
7385	objMarkus	Well...|| My hands are full,| as you can see...

7392	objBard	{shake .5}||.|.|.||ow.{/shake}	
7393	objBard	Why is the punching necessary??	
7394	objMarkus	{/shake}This way I'm able to act out my masculine insecurities!	
7395	objMarkus	With physical dominance!	
7397	objMiriam	Jerk...	
7398	objMarkus	Your actions are futile!	
7399	objMarkus	I will not relent without the jewel.	
7400	objMarkus	{shake .8}Give|| me|| {quake}the jewel!{/shake}	
7401	objBard	I'm trying to be nice!!	
7402	objMarkus	On one hand,| I don't understand why you keep running at me.	
7403	objMarkus	I am clearly much stronger than you.	
7404	objMarkus	On the other,| it is very satisfying for me to punch you.	
7405	objMarkus	So I welcome further attempts.	
7406	objMarkus	...Doesn't it hurt to be punched so many times?	
7407	objBard	Yes, very much!!	
7408	objMarkus	So why do you keep doing it?	
7409	objBard	I think it's what you want	
7410	objBard	I think I can beat you	
7411	objBard	I have no i|de|a	
7412	objMarkus	Hmmm.	
7413	objMarkus	...	
7414	objMarkus	That's very thoughtful...	
7415	objMarkus	...	
7416	objMarkus	So...|| you really don't have the jewel?	
7417	objBard	I really don't!!!	
7418	objMarkus	Hmmm.	
7419	objMarkus	Okay.|| That's enough.	
7420	objMarkus	I had rationalized that what I wanted was the jewel,	
7421	objMarkus	But I see now that all I really wanted was to act out on my subconscious aggressions.	
7422	objMarkus	Now that I've punched you eight times,	
7423	objMarkus	I no longer feel the drive for this that I did before.	
7424	objMarkus	I feel calm.	
7425	objMarkus	Thank you for doing this for me.	
7426	objMarkus	I'll remove myself from the situation now.

7437	objMarkus	My wife|| recently left me...

7441	objMarkus	You see?	
7442	objBard	Uh...	
7443	objMarkus	I'm glad you understand.

7457	objMarley	I've had the most wonderful life...	
7458	objMarley	Surrounded by lovely folks,| like you...	
7459	objMarley	And Francine...	
7460	objMarley	And all of Langtree...	
7461	objMarley	I couldn't ask for more.	
7462	objMarley	And yet,| I want to...	
7463	objMarley	I wish we all had more time,| little bird.	
7464	objMarley	Thank you for your smiles,	
7465	objMarley	And your music...	
7466	objMarley	I love you,| little bird.	
			
7467	objMarley	Hallo,| little bird!	
7468	objMarley	I've been hiding here from all the ghosts...	
7469	objMarley	If I wait long enough,| mayhaps they'll go away.	
7470	objMarley	What are you doing?	
7471	objBard	Hi|ding!	
7472	objBard	Sing|ing!	
7473	objBard	SAV|ING THE TOWN!!!	
7474	objMarley	Hmm...|| we're two peas in a pod!	
7475	objMarley	That's fine though,| isn't it?	
7476	objMarley	I'm sure the mayor will take care of the ghosts soon.	
7477	objMarley	I can see that!	
7478	objMarley	Business as usual,| then.	
7479	objMarley	That's just how I like it!	
7480	objMarley	Oh my!|| What a little hero!	
7481	objMarley	Do be careful,| little bird...	
7482	objMarley	Saving the town is what mayors are for.	
7483	objMarley	Between the old mayor's passing,| and now this...	
7484	objMarley	It's such a crisis for our little Langtree!	
7485	objMarley	But don't you worry.	
7486	objMarley	You didn't grow up here,| like the rest of us.	
7487	objMarley	So you may not know...	
7488	objMarley	But,| we've been through worse.	
7489	objMarley	And we always weather the storm.	
7490	objMarley	Have you seen Francine?	
7491	objMarley	She's visiting Ruby just beyond town.	
7492	objMarley	Ever since Ron passed...	
7493	objMarley	Everyone's been doing their part to help poor old Ruby.	
7494	objMarley	We aren't much,| but we always stick together.	
7495	objMarley	That's what I love about Langtree!	
7496	objMarley	I really wish I had her here with me,| though.	
7497	objMarley	Seeing you makes me feel a smidge better!	
7498	objMarley	Your youthful attitude is so infectious.	
7499	objMarley	Come to think of it...	
7500	objMarley	How old |{wiggle}are{/wiggle}| you?	
7501	objBard	Uh	
7502	objBard	Ummm	
7503	objBard	That's im|po|lite!	
7504	objBard	Still a kid!!!	
7505	objBard	Not THAT old??	
7506	objBard	Shrug!	
7507	objMarley	Well,|| still a child at heart, surely.	
7508	objMarley	Nothing wrong with that!	
7509	objMarley	You're like a songbird,	
7510	objMarley	bringing smiles wherever you go.	
7511	objMarley	Pleasure chatting with you, little bird.	
			
7512	objMarley	Everyone's reunited with their loved ones...	
7513	objMarley	Most importantly,| I have Francine home with me!	
7514	objMarley	So, I'm happy!	
7515	objMarley	I just wonder if they were serious about the world ending...	
7516	objMarley	To be honest...	
7517	objMarley	I had a feeling it was so.	
7518	objMarley	The world ending,| I mean.	
7519	objMarley	As if from a dream...	
7520	objMarley	It's just so much to take in.	
7521	objMarley	But if it's true,| at least I have Francine with me.	
			
7908	objMastanama	Well|, it's another day|'a war with Rulle!	
7909	objMastanama	Folks may not always talk about it,	
7910	objMastanama	But you can |{shake}BET{/shake}| it's on their minds,| heh!	
7911	objMastanama	Everyone's stressin' about the war,| running around...	
7912	objMastanama	But when ya get to my age| it's no big thing no more.	
7913	objMastanama	It's just life as a Chaandeshian...	
7914	objMastanama	Those animal lovers are scary for sure.	
7915	objMastanama	I hear they gots |{shake .5}monsters{/shake}| comin' after us!	
7917	objMastanama	But I also saw the Hero around here too!	
7918	objMastanama	I think Eya sent the Hero here to protect us.	
7919	objMastanama	Eya's on our side!	
7920	objMastanama	So harm'll never come to us here.	
			
7921	objMatilda	Oh!	
7922	objMatilda	You spooked me!	
7923	objMatilda	Why would you just run into someone's cabin?	
7924	objMatilda	Well...|| it so happens that I have a problem right now...	
7925	objMatilda	I'm singing for the band performing this evening,	
7926	objMatilda	But our conductor lost the music...|| shame!	
7927	objMatilda	What do you know about music?	
7928	objBard	No|thin'!	
7929	objBard	I CAN WRITE IT	
7930	objMatilda	Why would you just run into someone's cabin?	
7931	objBard	I du|nno	
7932	objBard	To write you mu|sic!	
7933	objMatilda	Are you gonna just stand there?	
7934	objMatilda	Or are you gonna write my part?	
7935	objBard	Stand.	
7936	objBard	MU|SIC!	
			
7937	objMatilda	Then leave me alone!	
7938	objMatilda	...	
			
7939	objMatilda	Is that so!	
7940	objMatilda	For the performance this evening?	
7941	objMatilda	Well,| I'll have you know...	
7942	objMatilda	My part is the absolute most important!	
7943	objMatilda	I'm dead middle!|| Part 2 of 3!	
7944	objMatilda	I have to keep the audience interested,	
7945	objMatilda	All while filling in the real MEAT of the song!	
7946	objMatilda	If you can write for that...	
7947	objMatilda	Then let's see what you got!	
7948	objMatilda	Remember,| I'm part 2 out of 3.	
7949	objMatilda	Let's hear it!	
7950	objMatilda	Laaa,|| laaa...|| this is the middle part!	
7951	objMatilda	How do you like it?	
7952	objBard	Sounds good!	
7953	objBard	Let's change it!	
7954	objMatilda	Why| thank you!	
7955	objMatilda	Hmm!|| Think we can do even better?	
7956	objMatilda	Let's hear how good the middle can be!	
			
7957	objMatilda	Oh,| it's you!	
7958	objMatilda	The creepy one...	
7959	objMatilda	Who escaped from jail,	
7960	objMatilda	Stowed away on my boat,	
7961	objMatilda	Snuck into my room,| and sang me a song.	
7962	objMatilda	Well,| how ya doing?	
7963	objMatilda	Break any more laws lately?	
7964	objMatilda	Mohabumi is a most wonderful,| musical city!	
7965	objMatilda	Hard to believe there are folks out there...	
7966	objMatilda	Working to destroy it!	
7967	objMatilda	Those monster-loving Rullers frighten me so!	
7968	objMatilda	Their jail must have been a nightmare.	
7969	objMatilda	I'm sure you've| seen...|| awful things.	
7970	objMatilda	No wonder you came out...|| so twisted...	
7971	objMatilda	Thankfully the war hasn't reached us here yet.	
7972	objMatilda	You've come to the right place to get away.	
7973	objMatilda	But its shadow lurks close!	
7974	objMatilda	There's talk of monsters in the forests...	
7975	objMatilda	Rullers all keep monsters of their own,| too.	
7976	objMatilda	Think that's a coincidence?	
7977	objMatilda	We won't be safe here forever.	
			
7978	objMatilda	Excuse me.	
7979	objMatilda	That was almost nothing!	
7980	objMatilda	How is that supposed to hold up the entire middle?!	
7981	objMatilda	Let's try that with a little more spirit!	
7982	objBard	Not right now...	
7983	objBard	I'll try!	
7984	objMatilda	Oh my!	
7985	objMatilda	That was quite complex!	
7986	objMatilda	...||But I don't think I can remember all of that...	
7987	objMatilda	Let's try that a bit simpler.	
7988	objBard	Not right now...	
7989	objBard	I'll try!	
7990	objMatilda	Oh.|| A quitter,| eh?	
7991	objMatilda	You'll never perservere through the all-important smiddle...	
7992	objMatilda	Not with an attitude like that!	
7993	objMatilda	Laaa,|| laaa...|| Is this right?	
7994	objBard	Let me try a|gain.	
7995	objBard	Yes!	
7996	objMatilda	Laaa,|| laaa...|| Is this right?	
7997	objBard	Let me try a|gain.

8003	objBard	Re|place this!	
8004	objMatilda	Well well well!|| Not bad!	
8005	objMatilda	That's it then,| isn't it?	
8006	objMatilda	We're due to perform quite soon!

8175	objMei	But of course that's not true...	
8176	objMei	I have all of our happy memories together,| too.	
8177	objMei	The flower wasn't worth much by comparison.

8272	objMermaid2	I like his pirate persona.

8274	objMermaid2	It's a cool new direction for us...

8322	objMiles	I've got a new job now.	
8323	objMiles	I'll never have to wear that cruddy Happy Kid mask again.	
8324	objMiles	And I'm finally putting my science degree to use.	
8325	objMiles	The factory's a lab now...|| have you heard?	
8326	objMiles	We're developing stuff that's gonna change the world.	
8327	objMiles	The Baron may have had some wacky ideas about toys,	
8328	objMiles	But the guy really knew how to build a production line.	
8329	objMiles	His stuff is gonna take us far.	
8330	objMiles	This isn't gonna be a crappy factory town anymore...	
8331	objMiles	Chismest is gonna be at the forefront of technology!	
8332	objMiles	I can feel it.	
8333	objMiles	||And on the side...	
8334	objMiles	I've been working on my book idea too.	
8335	objMiles	It's coming along.	
8336	objMiles	Doing something on my own time makes me feel like...	
8337	objMiles	My life is really together,| you know?

8351	objMiles	If my boss knew I was out of the costume...	
8352	objMiles	...|It wouldn't be pretty.

8354	objMiles	I need this job...

8356	objMiles	Happy Kid is such a load of garbage.

8380	objMiles	...	
8381	objMiles	I have no idea what to do,| actually.	
8382	objMiles	I think it's time for some kinda adventure.	
8383	objMiles	Gotta sow some chaos back into my life.	
8384	objMiles	Do the things I always wanted to!	
8385	objMiles	I've had this idea for a book kicking around in my head...	
8386	objMiles	Maybe|| I'll finally start that...	
			
8387	objBard	{size 1.5}Wow!|| Sure looks different.	
8388	objBard	What do you think happened,| Miriam?	
8389	objBard	Miriam?|| Are you ok?	
8390	objMiriam	{size .75}Obviously not	
8391	objBard	Miriam?|| Are you ok?	
8392	objMiriam	{size .75}No	
8393	objMiriam	I mean...||| I'll be fine.	
8394	objMiriam	But...	
8395	objMiriam	Everything sucks right now.	
8396	objBard	{size 1}Well...	
8397	objBard	I can carry you,| Miriam!	
8398	objMiriam	...	
			
8399	objMiriam	I did some research in the city...	
8400	objMiriam	We're going to meet the Moon Overseer.	
8401	objMiriam	The Moon's Queen.	
8402	objMiriam	And,| if I understand right...	
8403	objMiriam	We're gonna have to play the song I learned,	
8404	objMiriam	and the song that you learned,	
8405	objMiriam	at the same time.	
8406	objMiriam	No idea why.	
8407	objMiriam	But it means I'll enter with you...	
8409	objMiriam	Pretty standard by now,| right?	
8410	objMiriam	We'll probably land far apart, like last time.	
8411	objMiriam	But I'll meet up with you ASAP.	
8412	objMiriam	That's the plan.|| Any questions?	
8413	objBard	Nope!	
8414	objBard	Why do we land far a|part?	
8415	objBard	Ex|plain that thing a|gain?	
8416	objBard	The He|ro?!	
8417	objBard	The in|va|sion!	
8418	objBard	How are you feel|ing?	
8419	objMiriam	Oh,| her...	
8420	objMiriam	I heard the Witch Queen sent her off...	
8421	objMiriam	To go find a princess or something?	
8422	objBard	But that princess died!	
8423	objMiriam	Awesome.	
8424	objMiriam	I mean,|| not awesome,|| but...	
8425	objMiriam	That'll keep the Hero occupied for a while...	
8426	objMiriam	So that's good news for us.	
8427	objMiriam	Any more questions?	
8428	objMiriam	Yep.	
8429	objMiriam	It's today.	
8430	objMiriam	Looks like we beat it,| though.	
8431	objBard	Do you think everyone will be okay?	
8432	objMiriam	Probably||| not...	
8433	objMiriam	But what else we can do?	
8434	objMiriam	If these idiots wanna fight each other,	
8435	objMiriam	I guess...|| we have to just let 'em.	
8436	objBard	...	
8437	objMiriam	Stop giving me that look!	
8438	objMiriam	We're gonna {wiggle}save the world,{/wiggle}| remember?	
8439	objMiriam	We don't have time to fix |{wiggle}every| problem{/wiggle} on the way...	
8440	objMiriam	Any more questions?	
8441	objMiriam	I don't know.	
8442	objMiriam	||...|||Well...	
8443	objMiriam	The thing about the spirit world is,	
8444	objMiriam	None of it is "real"...|| the way things are here.	
8445	objMiriam	It's shaped by your mind,| and by the Overseer.	
8446	objMiriam	That's why it goes empty when an Overseer dies.	
8447	objMiriam	And different people see different things in it.	
8448	objMiriam	{size .8}(I bet it looks really different to the Hero...)	
8449	objMiriam	{size 1}So the space there is really chaotic and shifting,	
8450	objMiriam	distorting around each person there.	
8451	objMiriam	It's probably basically impossible for people to find each other.	
8452	objMiriam	{size 1}Except,| the castle where the Overseer lives...	
8453	objMiriam	It's a "center" that's the same for everyone.	
8454	objMiriam	So that's probably why we find each other there.	
8455	objMiriam	Guess I knew after all.	
8456	objMiriam	I just never put the pieces together...	
8457	objMiriam	Did that makes sense?	
8458	objMiriam	I can explain it again if you want.	
8459	objMiriam	Any more questions?	
8460	objMiriam	Sure.	
8461	objMiriam	I'll say it exactly the same way this time.	
8462	objMiriam	Huh?	
8463	objMiriam	I feel...||| fine|, I guess...	
8465	objMiriam	Pretty feelingsed out right now.	
8466	objMiriam	And ready to go meet an Overseer.	
8467	objBard	Yeah!!!	
8468	objBard	I couldn't do it without you,| Miriam!	
8469	objMiriam	Yeah.	
8472	objMiriam	Any more questions?	
8473	objMiriam	Okay,|| great.	
8474	objMiriam	Let's get it over with.	
			
8475	objBard	Is it gonna work?	
8476	objMiriam	Probably||| not...	
8477	objMiriam	But it doesn't |{wiggle}have{}| to work...	
8478	objMiriam	It just has to |{wiggle}look{}| like it will.	
8479	objMiriam	Potion-making runs in my blood.	
8480	objMiriam	It'll be fine.	
8482	objBard	Your parents make potions,| too?	
8483	objMiriam	I don't know.	
8484	objMiriam	Never met 'em.	
8485	objBard	Oh.	
8486	objMiriam	They left me with grandma before I can remember.	
8487	objMiriam	When I was a kid,| she'd tell me...	
8488	objMiriam	That they were coming back for me someday...	
8489	objMiriam	But eventually she stopped saying that.	
8490	objMiriam	They basically abandoned me.	
8491	objBard	Oh.	
8492	objBard	||I'm| sorry...	
8493	objBard	That sounds really sad.	
8494	objMiriam	Only when I think about it.	
8495	objMiriam	Grandma Saphy is all the family I ever needed.	
8496	objMiriam	She made me forget I was missing anything.	
8497	objMiriam	But I did always have a feeling...	
8498	objMiriam	That maybe|| if I worked hard enough,	
8499	objMiriam	And made myself into something...	
8500	objMiriam	Something heroic and famous...	
8501	objMiriam	That| they'd notice.	
8502	objMiriam	And realize what a mistake they made leaving me.	
8503	objMiriam	And| come back.	
8504	objMiriam	But that's a ridiculous idea.	
8505	objMiriam	I don't even care if I ever see them now.	
8506	objMiriam	Actually||, I'm pretty sure I never want to.	
8507	objMiriam	||{size .6}And I can't do anything heroic,| anyway...	
8508	objBard	{}We're going to save the world,| Miriam!	
8509	objMiriam	Trying to.	
8510	objMiriam	Would you look at that!|| Potion's done.	
8511	objBard	Um...	
8512	objBard	It looks|| weird...	
8513	objMiriam	Yeah.	
8514	objMiriam	It might actually be deadly.	
8517	objMiriam	Let's see if |{wiggle}the Hero{/wiggle} likes it!	
			
8519	objMiriam	...	
8520	objMiriam	So,| I got a closer look at this flower...	
8521	objMiriam	And|...|| it's not exactly the kind we need...	
8522	objMiriam	But,| it's pretty close,| so.	
8524	objMiriam	|||It's probably fine.	
8525	objMiriam	Well,| up to you to get the rest of 'em.	
8526	objMiriam	Good luck.	
8527	objMiriam	I'll wait by the lodge where the Hero's at.	
8528	objMiriam	Good news is,| this was the last one.	
8529	objMiriam	I saw a good mixing pot at the inn where the Hero's staying...	
8530	objMiriam	Let's go back there to fix this up.	
			
8531	objMiriam	{name}!	
8532	objMiriam	Screw that guy...	
8533	objMiriam	{shake .8}And screw the Hero!!!{/shake}	
8534	objMiriam	She |{wiggle}knows{/wiggle} we can't afford fancy potions...	
8535	objMiriam	She's trying to embarass us!!!	
8536	objMiriam	But I wasn't kidding.| We can make it ourselves!	
8537	objMiriam	It took me a minute to remember,	
8538	objMiriam	But I definitely know all the ingredients for that one...	
8539	objMiriam	|Probably...	
8541	objMiriam	Those are all the ingredients we need!	
8542	objMiriam	Just flowers and plants...	
8543	objMiriam	See?| Not that hard!	
8544	objMiriam	She probably assumed we would never be able to get it...	
8545	objMiriam	And that's why she agreed to help us at all...	
8546	objMiriam	But we can beat her at her own game.	
8547	objMiriam	Then she'll have to admit she was lying...	
8548	objMiriam	But since that's her pride on the line...	
8549	objMiriam	She'll probably actually take us to the King instead!	
8550	objBard	I'm not sure I'm following...	
8551	objMiriam	Doesn't matter!| Just get those ingredients!	
8552	objMiriam	I'm actually...| {shake .3}really excited...{/shake}| to show her up like this...	
8553	objMiriam	{size .7}Heh heh...{/size}	
			
8555	objMiriam	*sniff*|| *sniff*...	
8556	objMiriam	It still kinda smells out here...

8561	objMiriam	...	
8562	objMiriam	OK.	
8563	objMiriam	I'll be waiting outside of town.

8566	objMiriam	Well...|| we're here!

8653	objMiriam	Okay no you don't	
8654	objMiriam	But...	
8655	objMiriam	You know...|| who you ARE.	
8656	objBard	I do?	
8657	objMiriam	Oh shut up.	
8658	objMiriam	Yes,| you do.	
8659	objMiriam	You're always so sure...	
8660	objMiriam	Of what you want.	
8661	objMiriam	And you're always| so happy!	
8662	objMiriam	Like it's just easy.	
8663	objBard	It is!	
8664	objMiriam	...	
8665	objMiriam	Not for me.	
8666	objMiriam	How| do you do it?	
8667	objBard	Huh?	
8668	objBard	You mean...|| be happy?	
8669	objMiriam	Yeah,| how do you do it?	
8670	objMiriam	I want to be happy.	
8671	objBard	I don't know!	
8672	objMiriam	...	
8674	objBard	Maybe...|| it's not really that easy.	
8675	objBard	I have to try hard all the time.	
8676	objBard	Lots of stuff makes me feel sad.	
8678	objMiriam	Sure.	
8679	objMiriam	But then you just get over it!	
8680	objMiriam	Like when we were in Chismest.	
8681	objMiriam	You were so mopey about not being the hero.	
8682	objMiriam	And then...	
8683	objMiriam	You were fine again.	
8684	objBard	I dunno if I really got over it.	
8685	objBard	I just...	
8686	objBard	Stopped thinking about it.	
8687	objMiriam	Do you still wish you were the hero?	
8688	objBard	Yes.	
8689	objBard	I don't want to be mean...	
8690	objBard	But,	
8691	objBard	That girl...| who's the hero...	
8692	objBard	I think she's evil.	
8693	objMiriam	You think?	
8694	objBard	It's unfair.	
8695	objBard	Why| is she the hero?	
8696	objBard	All I wanted was to make a difference.	
8697	objBard	And save the world.	
8698	objBard	But I'm|| nobody...	
8700	objBard	Nothing I do| matters.	
8701	objBard	She's still killing Overseers.	
8702	objBard	Hala's message didn't stop the war.	
8703	objBard	And I keep trying,	
8704	objBard	But I'm scared...	
8705	objBard	That no matter how how hard I try,	
8706	objBard	I'll never change anything.	
8707	objMiriam	See,| that's what's good about you.	
8708	objBard	Huh?	
8711	objMiriam	Heroes...|| monsters...	
8712	objMiriam	Overseers...|| witches...	
8713	objMiriam	You're in way over your head.	
8714	objMiriam	You don't even have powers,	
8715	objMiriam	Like I do...	
8717	objMiriam	But you keep trying.	
8718	objMiriam	Even when it's hopeless.	
8719	objMiriam	I really...	
8720	objMiriam	...	
8721	objMiriam	Admire...	
8722	objMiriam	That...|| about you.	
8723	objMiriam	You don't have the same gifts I do.	
8724	objMiriam	But you keep racing ahead of me.	
8725	objMiriam	Sometimes...	
8726	objMiriam	It makes me feel useless...	
8727	objMiriam	But...	
8728	objMiriam	It's also inspiring.	
8729	objMiriam	I want to be like that.	
8730	objBard	Thanks...|| Miriam.	
8731	objMiriam	Dancing feels really good.	
8732	objBard	Yeah!!!	
8733	objMiriam	I didn't know.	
8734	objMiriam	But...	
8735	objMiriam	I needed this.	
8736	objBard	Yeah!!!	
8737	objBard	I'm glad you're having fun.	
8738	objMiriam	This band is from Delphi,| isn't it?	
8739	objMiriam	It's the one you played with...	
8740	objBard	Yeah!!!	
8741	objMiriam	I missed your show.	
8742	objMiriam	But| I dig this music right now.	
8743	objBard	Miriam!!!	
8744	objBard	You like music???	
8745	objBard	Is it really you??	
8746	objMiriam	They're from where I grew up.	
8747	objMiriam	It reminds me of home.	
8748	objMiriam	I thought, in a city of witches,	
8749	objMiriam	I'd find something familiar...	
8750	objMiriam	And learn about myself.	
8751	objMiriam	But,| so far,	
8752	objMiriam	The thing that's connected to me the most...	
8753	objMiriam	Is this music.	
8754	objMiriam	It makes me think about my grandma.	
8755	objMiriam	And red trees.	
8756	objMiriam	And all the stuff that makes me happy.	
8757	objBard	See,| Miriam!	
8758	objBard	That's the power of music!	
8759	objMiriam	...	
8760	objMiriam	I'm gonna dance here a while.	
8761	objMiriam	No more talking.	
8762	objMiriam	Just dancing.	
8763	objMiriam	Me time.	
8764	objMiriam	Okay?	
8765	objBard	Okay!	
			
8766	objBard	Miriam!	
8767	objMiriam	{shake}G||g||ggg||ahh!!	
8768	objBard	{}You got a broom!	
8770	objMiriam	{shake .7}Y-||yeah,	
8771	objMiriam	I had to do a bunch of pointless sidequests	
8772	objMiriam	But I got one of those cheap shop brooms	
8773	objMiriam	{shake .7}It's...|| not...|| exactly| good	
8775	objMiriam	Going more than a couple feet off the ground is...	
8776	objMiriam	Pretty terrifying	
8777	objMiriam	I'm trying to get used to it	
8778	objBard	{}Well,| that's okay!	
8779	objBard	Guess what!	
8780	objMiriam	{shake .7}what	
8781	objBard	{}I learned how to do MAGIC!	
8782	objMiriam	{shake}WHAT!!!	
8783	objBard	{}Singing can do magic!	
8784	objBard	And not just,| like,| the magic of friendship	
8785	objBard	But real magic,| like spells that do things!	
8786	objMiriam	{shake .7}Th-|that's| great...	
8787	objMiriam	{shake .7}Well,	
8788	objMiriam	I'm in no shape to take a passenger yet...	
8789	objMiriam	So I guess keep doing your thing	
8790	objMiriam	Figure out how to get into the castle	
8791	objMiriam	I'll learn how to fly this thing,	
8792	objMiriam	And then we can join forces	
8793	objMiriam	{shake}*Gasp*||| *Gasp*	
8794	objMiriam	{shake .7}This is...|| embarrassing...	
8795	objMiriam	I only ever flew my grandma's broom!!	
8796	objMiriam	Everyone here makes it look so easy...	
8797	objMiriam	And I look like||| an idiot!!	
8798	objMiriam	I guess now I'm just...|| the failure witch...	
8799	objMiriam	Who can't even do basic witch things...	
8800	objBard	{}It's okay!	
8801	objBard	I can't fly brooms,| either...	
8802	objMiriam	{shake}YEAH,|| but you aren't A WITCH!!!	
			
8803	objMiriam	So...|| they make potions here...	
8804	objBard	That's your speciality,| right?	
8805	objMiriam	Uh...|| more like my grandma's speciality...	
8806	objMiriam	I just picked up some things from her.	
8807	objMiriam	But we could never make potions like these.	
8808	objMiriam	We just used what was around us in Delphi.	
8809	objBard	What's |{wiggle}your{/wiggle}| speciality?	
8810	objMiriam	Hmm...	
8811	objMiriam	I guess,| I'm pretty good...	
8812	objMiriam	At blowing stuff up.	
8813	objMiriam	With my fingertips.	
8814	objBard	That's very violent,| Miriam!!!	
8815	objBard	Do you really like blowing things up?!	
8816	objMiriam	Well...|| yeah!	
8817	objMiriam	It's really fun!	
8818	objMiriam	I dunno...	
8819	objMiriam	That's just what my magic...|| does.	
8820	objMiriam	But magic is so different,| here...	
8821	objMiriam	Witches have all these different uses for it.	
8822	objMiriam	They do lots of things with it.	
8823	objMiriam	I feel so...|| simple,| by comparison...	
8824	objMiriam	I thought doing magic made me a witch.	
8825	objMiriam	But we're barely even the same thing.	
8826	objMiriam	I feel so different from everyone here...	
8827	objMiriam	My grandma's the only one who feels like home.	
8828	objMiriam	And we haven't talked in a |{wiggle}loooooong{/wiggle}|| time.	
8829	objMiriam	I keep wondering if she's okay...	
8830	objBard	I bet she's worried about you too!	
8831	objMiriam	Yeah.	
8832	objMiriam	And,|| I mean...	
8833	objMiriam	You know...	
8834	objMiriam	What if we don't make it in the end?	
8835	objMiriam	What if the world ends?	
8836	objMiriam	Last time I saw her could have been the last.	
8837	objBard	I never thought about that.	
8838	objMiriam	Well,|| I did.	
8839	objBard	I think we'll make it back,| Miriam.	
8840	objBard	I guess I don't know for sure.	
8841	objBard	Either way...	
8842	objBard	You don't have to feel alone!	
8843	objBard	Because...|| you have me!	
8844	objMiriam	That's nice.	
			
8845	objMiriam	So this is a Witch Academy...	
8846	objMiriam	I never thought there'd be| a school just for magic.	
8847	objMiriam	It seems...|| so boring to study!	
8848	objBard	Whaaaaaat?	
8849	objBard	Magic is cool,| Miriam!	
8850	objMiriam	Yeah of course it is!!!	
8851	objMiriam	So why would you study it??	
8852	objMiriam	Magic is all about| doing cool things...	
8853	objMiriam	Reading about it seems like a waste.	
8854	objMiriam	So wait...	
8855	objMiriam	You can do magic by singing,| huh?	
8856	objBard	Sure can!	
8857	objBard	They said magic is "advanced music!"	
8858	objBard	Umm,| I guess so!	
8859	objBard	It's how I got here...	
8860	objBard	It feels like |music...	
8861	objBard	Might be a kind of magic!	
8862	objBard	Or maybe even the other way around!	
8863	objBard	Magic is a kind of music!	
8864	objBard	I always knew music was magical!	
8865	objMiriam	How is it that I did magic my whole life...	
8866	objMiriam	And I {shake 1}NEVER| KNEW| THAT?{/shake}	
8867	objMiriam	It feels so weird...	
8868	objMiriam	It's like,| this thing I've had my whole life,	
8869	objMiriam	Was keeping secrets from me...	
8870	objMiriam	Did grandma Saphy know?	
8871	objMiriam	She never really|| taught me stuff...	
8872	objMiriam	We just went outside,| and DID stuff.	
8873	objMiriam	To me,| magic was always a thing that just|| was.	
8874	objMiriam	To think it's something with an origin,	
8875	objMiriam	That you can |study...|| and understand...	
8876	objMiriam	It takes the magic out of it...	
8877	objBard	Even if magic is made of music,	
8878	objBard	That doesn't really take the mystery out!	
8879	objBard	Music is an even bigger mystery,| Miriam!	
8880	objMiriam	What?	
8881	objMiriam	No it isn't.	
8882	objMiriam	Music is just,| like...	
8883	objMiriam	Notes...| like A B C...	
8884	objMiriam	That you can count and put in order.	
8885	objBard	{shake}WHAT?{/shake}	
8886	objBard	{shake}OH{/shake}| my gosh,| Miriam.	
8887	objBard	That isn't even close!!!	
8888	objBard	Music is so much more than that!	
8889	objBard	Trust me.|| I'm a pro!	
8890	objBard	Music is sounds,| and vibrations...	
8891	objBard	It's the way the whole universe moves!	
8892	objBard	{wiggle}Nobody{/wiggle}| can understand all of it.	
8893	objMiriam	Hmm.	
8894	objMiriam	Well,| that's not really what magic is,| to me...	
8895	objMiriam	But I guess it sounds better than just notes.	
8896	objBard	I think that's okay!	
8897	objBard	The other thing is,	
8898	objBard	It can be|| whatever you want it to be!	
8899	objMiriam	Sure.	
8900	objMiriam	But I don't know why you'd want to study it.	
8901	objBard	Because learning is fun!	
8902	objMiriam	Okay.	
			
8903	objMiriam	I can finally explore the rest of this market!	
8904	objMiriam	There's| a lot here.	
8905	objMiriam	{size .7}(Mostly crap...)	
8906	objMiriam	{}I guess this is what witches like though?	
8907	objMiriam	I was checking out this candy.	
8908	objMiriam	||It's really weird.	
8909	objMiriam	Saphy never made stuff like this.	
8910	objMiriam	All this candy is made from stuff around here.	
8911	objMiriam	You'd never see this back in Delphi.	
8912	objMiriam	There's this one familiar flavor, though...	
8913	objMiriam	It's kind of like this wild mushroom we used to pick.	
8914	objMiriam	It grew under the trees in Delphi.	
8915	objMiriam	She would cook it into everything.	
8916	objMiriam	I don't think it's exactly the same,	
8917	objMiriam	But the taste really reminds me of those mushrooms...	
8918	objMiriam	I wonder if she was trying to mimic this.	
8919	objMiriam	I wonder if Saphy ever lived here?	
8920	objMiriam	She never told me about it if she did.	
8921	objMiriam	I never even asked her where she came from...	
8922	objMiriam	I wish I had.	
8924	objMiriam	I like to think she was here once.	
8925	objMiriam	Or maybe she grew up here!	
8926	objMiriam	I don't know why,| but I like to think that.	
			
8927	objMiriam	I guess they sell brooms|| in this witch city.	
8928	objMiriam	Don't know why I didn't think of that.	
8929	objMiriam	...	
8930	objMiriam	{size .7}They all look like crap though...	
8931	objBard	{size 1}We don't have money,| also!	
8932	objMiriam	||Oh yeah...	
8933	objMiriam	This always happens to us.	
8934	objMiriam	How are we ever gonna get anywhere?	
8938	objMiriam	Apparently, if you can't fly...	
8939	objMiriam	You can't even get to most of the city.	
8940	objMiriam	Really missing my broom right now.	
8941	objMiriam	I really wanted to see the city,| too...	
8942	objMiriam	I've never been around so many witches...	
8943	objMiriam	One way or another,| we have to meet the Queen.	
8944	objMiriam	She's got the Overseer's song, right?	
8946	objBard	Don't worry,| Miriam!	
8947	objBard	I have...|| {wiggle}a plan!{/wiggle}	
8948	objMiriam	Really?|| To meet the Queen?	
8949	objBard	Mhm!	
8950	objMiriam	Huh.|| Ok.	
8951	objMiriam	I'll work on getting a broom...| somehow.	
			
8952	objMiriam	{wiggle}Sigh...{/wiggle}	
8953	objMiriam	I didn't realize the capital was still so far.	
8954	objMiriam	We're gonna be on this boat all day.	
8955	objBard	It's just like when we were pirates!	
8956	objBard	Remember that,| Miriam?	
8957	objMiriam	No.|| I completely forget.	
8958	objMiriam	I must have hit my head.	
8959	objMiriam	Many times.	
8960	objBard	Yeah!|| We hung out with pirates!	
8961	objBard	And they really liked coffee,| and...	
8962	objBard	...	
8963	objBard	Oh.|| You're joking.	
8964	objMiriam	Sometimes I wish you were too.	
8965	objMiriam	I've never been to Chaandesh.	
8966	objMiriam	Is it where |all| witches are from?	
8967	objMiriam	I wonder if my parents ever lived here.	
8968	objMiriam	...	
8969	objMiriam	It's a little weird...	
8970	objMiriam	I've never really been around other witches before.	
8971	objMiriam	Grandma Saphy told me there was a kingdom of witches...	
8972	objMiriam	Never crossed my mind to go,| though.	
8973	objMiriam	Back in Delphi| I was the only witch.	
8974	objMiriam	It made me kinda special.	
8975	objMiriam	This whole kingdom feels like...	
8976	objMiriam	A big club,| that I was never invited to.	
8977	objMiriam	I'm just gonna stay here,| and...	
8978	objMiriam	Avoid talking to anyone...	
			
8979	objMiriam	That was the broom my grandma used when she was young...	
8981	objMiriam	She used to tell me it'd be mine when I was old enough.	
8982	objMiriam	||...The day she passed it to me...	
8983	objMiriam	was probably the happiest in my whole life...	
8984	objMiriam	And now it's wrecked...	
8985	objBard	{}I'm sorry,| Miriam!	
8986	objMiriam	...	
8987	objMiriam	How are we even gonna get anywhere now?	
8988	objMiriam	The other nexus points are so far away...	
8989	objMiriam	Stupid people,| just blasting whatever they want...	
8990	objMiriam	I want my broom back.	
8991	objMiriam	I hope that stupid monster eats them.	
8993	objBard	I kinda wanna go see it...	
8994	objMiriam	I don't.	
8995	objMiriam	But you have fun.	
8996	objMiriam	Call me over if they're getting eaten.	
			
8999	objMiriam	Well?|| How's it going out there?	
9000	objBard	The monster is really,|| really big!	
9001	objMiriam	Good.	
9002	objMiriam	I really hope it eats them.	
9003	objBard	Um.||| Do you wanna just sit here?	
9004	objMiriam	I'm |{quake}{shake}sulking!!!{/shake}	
9005	objMiriam	I'm really pissed about my broom.	
9006	objMiriam	Okay?	
9007	objMiriam	It was basically the only good thing in my whole life.	
9008	objMiriam	Now I have to adjust to existing without it.	
9009	objMiriam	It sucks.	
9010	objMiriam	And I hate those stupid witches.	
9011	objMiriam	You just gonna stand there and watch me sulk?	
9012	objBard	I dunno!	
9013	objMiriam	Cool.	
9014	objMiriam	Can you not though?	
			
9015	objMiriam	I used to do this all the time with my grandma.	
9016	objMiriam	Collecting stuff for a potion,| I mean.	
9017	objMiriam	We'd go into the forest and pick mushrooms and stuff...	
9018	objMiriam	This is ||kinda like that...	
9019	objBard	Were you always really grumpy as a kid,| too?	
9020	objMiriam	...	
9021	objMiriam	Making a potion...	
9022	objMiriam	It really does make me think of Grandma Saphy.	
9023	objMiriam	I kinda wish she was here.	
9024	objMiriam	She knew a lot about potion ingredients.	
9025	objMiriam	I don't really know what I'm doing...	
9026	objMiriam	|I hope she's doing okay.	
9027	objMiriam	None of the ingredients we need are crazy rare...	
9028	objMiriam	So...| we can |{wiggle}probably{/wiggle}| find them all around this region...	
9029	objMiriam	Probably...	
			
9030	objMiriam	You got all the ingredients?	
9031	objBard	Heck| yeah!	
9032	objMiriam	Great.	
9033	objMiriam	Let's see 'em.	
9034	objMiriam	...	
9035	objBard	...	
9036	objMiriam	Literally none of these are right.	
9037	objBard	Huh?	
9038	objMiriam	I mean,| they're close.	
9039	objMiriam	But they're all the wrong species| or off color.	
9040	objBard	Oh.	
9041	objMiriam	Also,|| the frog was supposed to be alive...	
9042	objBard	Oh.	
9043	objMiriam	I can work with this though.	
9044	objMiriam	There's a pot inside the lodge here we can use.	
9045	objMiriam	||Hopefully the Hero doesn't notice us...	
			
9046	objMiriam	Hey.	
9047	objMiriam	{shake}Shut up!!!{/shake}	
9048	objMiriam	Have you ever stopped and noticed...	
9049	objMiriam	That the Hero goes around fighting monsters with a cool sword...	
9050	objMiriam	And |{shake}WE{/shake}| get stuck doing yardwork?	
9052	objMiriam	If she were here...|| she'd just take the dumb flower...	
9053	objMiriam	Why aren't {wiggle}we?{}	
9054	objMiriam	In case you forgot,|| the world is about to end.	
9055	objMiriam	{shake .5}It doesn't {shake}matter{shake .5} if this old lady has leaves in her yard!!!{/shake}	
9056	objMiriam	But I mean.| Whatever.|| You do you.	
			
9057	objMiriam	Hey!| I found one of the ingredients...	
9058	objMiriam	It's in this |rich person's backyard...	
9059	objMiriam	I was thinking about just|| taking it...	
9060	objBard	{quake}{shake}WHAT!!!{/shake}|| No way!!	
9061	objBard	What would your grandma think if you did that??	
9062	objMiriam	{size .7}Sheesh,| okay,| sheesh!	
9063	objBard	{size 1}Let's|| ask for it!	
9064	objBard	It's just a flower.| No big deal!	
9065	objMiriam	Go right ahead.	
9066	objMiriam	{wiggle .5}"What would my grandma think"...{/wiggle}|| okay, dweeb.	
9067	objMiriam	You don't even know my grandma!	
9068	objBard	{shake .6}Is she a...|| {shake}criminal???{/shake}	
9069	objMiriam	{/shake}What?| No	
9070	objMiriam	She's a super sweet old lady!	
9071	objMiriam	I mean you're right she wouldn't like me stealing,	
9072	objMiriam	It's just...	
9073	objMiriam	{size .7}You didn't |{wiggle}know{/wiggle}| that...	
			
9074	objMiriam	So now what?	
9075	objMiriam	Wanna just take it?

9519	objMiriam	Ready when you are.	
9520	objMiriam	Well lookie who it is!!!	
9522	objMiriam	Do you know how long I've been waiting here?	
9523	objMiriam	Where were you??	
9524	objBard	Well,| I met an astronomer...	
9525	objBard	Who wants to shut down the factory...	
9526	objMiriam	{shake}{quake}ARE YOU KIDDING ME???{/shake}	
9527	objMiriam	There's a Hero prancing around killing Overseers!	
9528	objMiriam	We don't have time for your|| {shake .3}shenanigans!{/shake}	
9529	objBard	Sorry	
9530	objMiriam	Well.| While you were busy moping around...	
9532	objMiriam	I |{wiggle}actually{/wiggle}| got a lot done for us.	
9533	objMiriam	I found the Overseer song!	
9534	objMiriam	So we can skip right to the Overseer of this place.	
9535	objBard	...There's an Overseer here...?	
9536	objMiriam	Uh.|| Yeah!	
9537	objMiriam	{size 1.8}You're standing right at the nexus point!	
9538	objBard	||Oh!	
9539	objMiriam	{size 1}And get this.| The Overseer song?	
9540	objMiriam	It's| the lullaby your mom used to sing to you.	
9541	objBard	I already know that song!	
9542	objMiriam	Yeah,| total plot twist,| I know.	
9544	objBard	So I just have to sing it...	
9545	objMiriam	That's what I'm saying.	
9546	objMiriam	Ready when you are.	
			
9547	objMiriam	Well?|| Come on...	
9548	objMiriam	Sing your mom's old lullaby!	
9549	objMiriam	...	
9550	objMiriam	Just sing.|| I'm waiting.	
			
9551	objMiriam	The nexus point is blocked by these gross clouds...	
9552	objMiriam	{name}!|| You have to find a way to shut down the factory!	
9553	objMiriam	Ugh,| it kinda smells too.	
9554	objMiriam	This town is| grody.	
9555	objMiriam	There has to be some way to stop the factory...	
9556	objMiriam	Come on!| Go figure it out!	
			
9557	objMiriam	What do you want	
9558	objBard	...	
9559	objBard	Well,| I have this letter...	
9560	objBard	For a girl...|| standing here...||| at this time?	
9561	objMiriam	...So it's for me.	
9562	objBard	I||| guess so??	
9563	objMiriam	{size .7}What is this

9573	objMiriam	Still holding that thing???|| Come on	
9574	objMiriam	Sheesh,| it's cold out here.	
9575	objMiriam	Mm.| Your house is toasty.	
9576	objMiriam	Any progress on shutting down that factory yet?	
9577	objMiriam	I can tell you rumors about stuff around town...	
9578	objMiriam	Not like I have anything |else| to contribute.	
9579	objMiriam	Apparently there's an astronomer outside of town...	
9580	objMiriam	They have a big telescope.	
9581	objMiriam	So,| who knows what kinda stuff they know,| right?	
9582	objMiriam	Maybe you should try finding them.	
9583	objMiriam	I'll just keep| wandering around here...	
9584	objMiriam	Nobody knows much about the astronomer.	
9585	objMiriam	They just reasearch stuff at their telescope all day.	
9586	objMiriam	But...| they have to eat sometime,| right?	
9587	objMiriam	Sounds hokey,| but grandma Saphy always said...	
9588	objMiriam	{wiggle}"Look to the stars for answers..."{/wiggle}	
9589	objMiriam	That's what makes me think the astronomer might know something.	
9590	objMiriam	Well?|| Anything???	
9591	objBard	I met an astronomer from here...	
9592	objBard	She wants to shut down the factory,| too.	
9593	objMiriam	{shake .5}Perfect!!!{/shake}	
9594	objMiriam	So what do I blast?	
9595	objBard	Huh?	
9596	objMiriam	She's a scientist,| right?	
9597	objMiriam	So she knows where to hit to knock out the whole system!	
9598	objMiriam	{shake .5}What do I blast?!{/shake}	
9599	objBard	|...We aren't blasting anything.	
9600	objMiriam	Oh.	
9601	objBard	We're gonna get sad people from around town...	
9602	objBard	And mess it up from inside.	
9603	objMiriam	Oh.	
9604	objMiriam	||Okay...	
9605	objMiriam	I liked my plan better.	
9606	objMiriam	But| I guess...	
9607	objMiriam	We'll do yours instead.	
9608	objMiriam	Well,| let me know,	
9609	objMiriam	If you wanna hear rumors from around town...	
9610	objMiriam	Or something...	
9611	objMiriam	So we're looking for sad aimless people, huh?	
9612	objMiriam	I can at least tell you about who I spot,| if you want.	
9613	objMiriam	Not like I have anything |{shake .3}else{/shake}| to do.	
9614	objMiriam	There's that sad guy on the roof by your house.	
9615	objMiriam	There's that sad guy on the roof around here.	
9616	objMiriam	You know,| constantly playing music.	
9617	objMiriam	He seems depressed.|| Maybe he'll help us.	
9618	objMiriam	There's that whiny dude who's always crying and wandering around.	
9619	objMiriam	Something about him| really rubs me the wrong way...	
9620	objMiriam	||...there have to be better options than that,| right?	
9621	objMiriam	That sad roof guy seems like your type.	
9622	objMiriam	All musical and mopey.	
9623	objMiriam	But how the heck do you get up there...?	
9624	objMiriam	That whiny dude really seems like he needs a friend.	
9625	objMiriam	How could anyone deal with someone so whiny, though?	
9626	objMiriam	I can't imagine what that must be like...	
9627	objMiriam	...Need help finding people to shut down the factory?	
9628	objBard	Just one more!	
9629	objMiriam	Hrmmm.	
9630	objMiriam	You're on your own with this one.	
9631	objMiriam	I can't think of anyone.	
9632	objMiriam	Everyone in this lousy town already has a job...	
9633	objBard	What about you?	
9634	objMiriam	|What?	
9635	objMiriam	No.	
9636	objBard	Come on, Miriam!!	
9637	objMiriam	||What	
9638	objBard	Why can't you help us?	
9639	objMiriam	...	
9640	objMiriam	Why me?	
9641	objBard	Because you're the only one left!	
9642	objMiriam	Yeah.	
9643	objMiriam	{wiggle}Real{/wiggle}| flattering.	
9644	objMiriam	Glad to be your last resort.	
9645	objMiriam	You know...	
9646	objMiriam	This used to be |{wiggle}my{/wiggle}| adventure.	
9647	objMiriam	Just me and grandma Saphy.	
9648	objMiriam	But ever since you showed up...	
9649	objMiriam	Somehow I never get to do anything anymore.	
9650	objMiriam	Even though |{wiggle}I'm{/wiggle}| the one with the magic powers.	
9651	objMiriam	How do you think that feels?	
9652	objMiriam	|||She probably thinks I'm useless.	
9653	objMiriam	She trusted me {shake .8}so little{}| she asked you to help me.	
9654	objMiriam	{quake}{shake .3}And then!!!	
9655	objMiriam	You basically proved her right!!!{}	
9656	objMiriam	How do you think ||{shake .8}that{/shake}| feels?	
9657	objBard	I...!|| Well...	
9658	objBard	I think I know how that feels...	
9659	objBard	Like when I found out someone else was the hero...	
9660	objBard	It made me feel so...	
9661	objBard	||...pointless.	
9662	objBard	I don't belong on an adventure.	
9663	objMiriam	Yeah| except you're obviously useful!	
9664	objMiriam	You sing us through every problem!	
9665	objBard	{wiggle}You're{/wiggle}| obviously useful!	
9666	objBard	You can fly| and you always know what to do next!	
9667	objMiriam	...	
9668	objMiriam	Somehow...	
9669	objMiriam	Hearing that from you...	
9670	objMiriam	Doesn't make me feel better at all.	
9671	objBard	Me neither.	
9672	objBard	But that's why we gotta do this!	
9673	objBard	Together!	
9674	objBard	We gotta |{shake .1}{quake}prove{}| that we aren't useless!!	
9675	objBard	We can't do it if we don't try!	
9678	objMiriam	...	
9679	objMiriam	{size .7}Okay...	
9680	objMiriam	{}Fine.	
9681	objMiriam	I'll help.	
9682	objMiriam	This time!	
9683	objMiriam	I'll see you at the nighttime diner meeting.	
9684	objMiriam	So this is the secret meeing,| huh?	
9685	objMiriam	How are these bozos gonna shut down the factory...?	
9686	objMiriam	Now that I'm actually included...	
9687	objMiriam	I can't believe I was jealous of this...	
9688	objMiriam	Everyone here seems all depressed,| or nerdy.	
9689	objMiriam	...	
9690	objMiriam	{shake .3}Sigh...{/shake}| and now I'm one of them...	
9691	objMiriam	Your mom reminds me of grandma Saphy...	
9692	objMiriam	||It's nice.	
9693	objMiriam	I kinda miss her...	
9694	objMiriam	Yeah yeah,| I'm on your team now or whatever.	
9695	objMiriam	I'll go to your nightly meetings and stuff.	
9696	objMiriam	But...| the point's still to shut down the factory,| right?	
9697	objMiriam	Wonder what'll happen to this town...	
9698	objMiriam	If we actually do it.	
9699	objMiriam	The factory's the center of everything...	
9700	objMiriam	Sheesh!!!	
9701	objMiriam	My back's all tense...	
9702	objMiriam	From walking in this stupid cold!	
9703	objMiriam	Let's get out of here soon...	
			
9704	objMiriam	...	
9705	objMiriam	So...	
9706	objMiriam	This is goodbye,| huh?	
9708	objBard	Just for now!	
9710	objBard	But we're gonna hang out all the time!	
9711	objBard	Right?	
9712	objMiriam	I hope so...	
9714	objBard	I'm tired.	
9715	objMiriam	|Me too.	
9716	objBard	We came a really long way together,

9718	objMiriam	Yeah.	
9719	objBard	Thanks...|| for saving the world with me!	
9720	objMiriam	Yeah...	
9721	objMiriam	|Thanks...

9727	objBard	You fly this broom really well!	
9728	objBard	It's like you never lost your old one!

9733	objBard	About your broom||, and also...	
9734	objBard	We promised to work together more...	
9735	objBard	But I met the Queen without you.	
9736	objBard	Are you upset with me?	
9739	objMiriam	Nah.	
9740	objMiriam	I'm still upset my broom broke.	
9741	objMiriam	But I'm not mad at you.	
9742	objMiriam	I had a lot of stuff||| to think about,| anyway.	
9743	objBard	Stuff like what?	
9744	objMiriam	Like everything.	
9745	objMiriam	Why am I doing this,| why am I here...	
9746	objMiriam	It was weird being in a city of other witches.	
9748	objMiriam	I thought it'd be a place where I fit in.	
9749	objMiriam	But I didn't.	
9754	objBard	That just means you're special!	
9755	objMiriam	Well.	
9756	objMiriam	Maybe...|| I don't want to be so special.	
9757	objMiriam	I've been special my whole life.	
9758	objMiriam	Around Delphi,| me and Saphy were the only witches.	
9759	objMiriam	I never knew someone else like me.	
9760	objMiriam	And I guess I still don't.	
9761	objMiriam	It doesn't feel good to be different like this.	
9762	objMiriam	I feel like I'm just messed up.	
9763	objMiriam	And I'll never fit in| anywhere.	
9764	objBard	I don't fit in either,| Miriam...	
9766	objMiriam	What?|| Yes you do.	
9767	objMiriam	Everywhere you go,| you make lots of friends.	
9768	objMiriam	Everyone loves you.	
9769	objMiriam	No|body loves me.	
9770	objBard	I love you!	
9771	objBard	I mean,| like a friend...	
9772	objMiriam	I know.	
9773	objBard	And maybe I do make friends,	
9774	objBard	But it's not because I fit in,| or I'm like them.	
9775	objBard	Everywhere we go,| I'm an outsider too.	
9776	objBard	Just being on this adventure is wrong for me...	
9777	objBard	I'm not a hero...	
9778	objBard	I'm not supposed to be here.	
9779	objBard	But,| you make me feel like I am!	
9780	objBard	We're outsiders...|| together!	
9781	objBard	I'm glad that we're friends!	
9782	objMiriam	You know...	
9783	objMiriam	You're probably the only person I know...	
9784	objMiriam	That I'd call a friend.	
9785	objMiriam	I'm glad we're friends, too.	
			
9786	objMiriam	Okay,| get off here!	
			
9787	objBard	{size 1.5}{background #230E30}{color #F43D5E}What happened?	
9788	objMiriam	Oh,| there you are.	
9789	objMiriam	You sang your stupid message to the King.	
9790	objBard	{shake .5}OH!{/shake}|| Right!| The message!	
9791	objBard	The ghost was actually a princess|| from Chaandesh!	
9792	objMiriam	Ahuh.	
9793	objBard	And she wanted the war to end...	
9794	objBard	Did it work?	
9795	objBard	The message?	
9796	objMiriam	|||No.	
9797	objMiriam	It completely did not work.	
9798	objMiriam	The King was really insulted by it.	
9799	objMiriam	He threw you in jail.	
9801	objMiriam	And then,| eventually,| he taught the Hero the song...	
9802	objMiriam	And I had to spy on them to learn it,	
9803	objMiriam	And then I had to bust you out of jail...	
9804	objMiriam	And it was pretty cool and heroic,| and...	
9805	objMiriam	...	
9806	objMiriam	Jeez.	
9807	objMiriam	You were really passed out for all of that?	
9808	objBard	Guess so!	
9809	objBard	...	
9810	objBard	I'm sorry I caused so many problems...	
9811	objBard	It's a good thing you were there to help me out.	
9812	objBard	Again...	
9813	objMiriam	That's fine.	
9814	objMiriam	I'm getting used to saving your butt.	
9815	objBard	{shake}OH!{/shake}|| Wait...!	
9816	objBard	The King said they were invading in 3 days!	
9817	objBard	Is that still gonna happen?	
9818	objBard	What are we gonna do,| Miriam?	
9819	objMiriam	It's 2 days now.	
9820	objMiriam	And,|| I don't know.	
9821	objMiriam	It's not our problem.	
9822	objMiriam	For now,| we're going...	
9824	objMiriam	To the |{wiggle}Sky Temple.{/wiggle}	
9825	objMiriam	The nexus point,|| right on the border.	
9826	objMiriam	We have everything we need to go meet the Overseer...	
9827	objMiriam	And that's the priority.	
9831	objMiriam	In| fact...	
9832	objMiriam	We're gonna get there...|| now.	
			
9833	objBard	Well!|| Up up and away!	
9834	objMiriam	Uh,| what?	
9835	objBard	Let's fly!	
9836	objMiriam	||No.	
9837	objBard	No?	
9838	objMiriam	I'm tired.	
9839	objMiriam	I slept on a floor.	
9840	objMiriam	Barely.	
9841	objMiriam	{wiggle}You{}| try carrying you for a couple days.	
9842	objMiriam	See how you feel about doing it another day after that.	
9843	objMiriam	You're walking.	
			
9844	objBard	{size 1.5}{background #000D28}{color #FEB00B}I was thinking...	
9845	objBard	About what the hero said...	
9846	objBard	|||Are the Overseers really...| evil?	
9848	objMiriam	{wiggle}Evil?{/wiggle}|| I dunno...	
9849	objMiriam	I hate her guts, so...	
9850	objMiriam	Whatever she wants, it's bad.	
9854	objMiriam	Remember,| she's just following the rules.	
9855	objMiriam	The same rules that say she's the hero.	
9856	objMiriam	And all the rules say the planet is {shake .2}SUPPOSED{/shake} to die...	
9859	objMiriam	So, if we're gonna save it,	
9860	objMiriam	We have to break the rules.	
9861	objMiriam	The Earthsong is a pretty big mystery to me and grandma.	
9862	objMiriam	We don't know what happened in past universes...	
9863	objMiriam	Like,| did anyone ever |{shake .4}TRY{/shake}| to get the pieces before?	
9864	objMiriam	Does it even {shake .4}WORK??{/shake}	
9865	objMiriam	Heck if I know!	
9867	objBard	But...| we have to try?	
9868	objMiriam	Yeah, that's what grandma said.

9874	objMiriam	Doesn't matter.	
9875	objMiriam	We're getting close now.	
9876	objMiriam	I'm gonna go down.	
			
9884	objMiriam	This is the nexus point.	
9885	objMiriam	The {wiggle}Breathing Crystals{/wiggle}...	
9886	objMiriam	Useless without the Queen of Wind's song,| though.	
			
9887	objMiriam	Finally outta there!!	
9889	objMiriam	Just ahead is a town called Delphi.	
9890	objMiriam	If anyone knows the Queen of Wind's song, that's where they are.	
9891	objMiriam	I'm tired of waiting around for you...| so I'll see ya there!	
			
9892	objMiriam	Do you remember this place?	
9893	objMiriam	It's where we first met.	
9894	objMiriam	I picked you up on my broom,| here...	
9895	objMiriam	And flew you to Delphi.	
9896	objBard	Oh yeah!	
9897	objBard	That's how our adventure started.	
9898	objMiriam	It feels like forever ago...	
			
9899	objMiriam	This place got really torn up.	
9900	objMiriam	I was here once,| looking for the Overseer song...	
9901	objBard	This is where we first met,| Miriam!	
9902	objMiriam	Huh?|| Really?	
9905	objBard	I was on my way to Langtree!	
9906	objBard	And you were kinda rude to me...	
9907	objMiriam	Oh.	
9908	objMiriam	Well,| that sounds like me.	
9910	objMiriam	But everyone I asked was panicking about ghosts.	
9911	objMiriam	And then you found it,| I guess.	
			
9912	objBard	What was it like seeing Saphy again?	
9913	objMiriam	It was nice.	
9914	objMiriam	I really missed her...	
9915	objMiriam	Maybe it's stupid,| but...	
9916	objMiriam	I was so worried...	
9917	objMiriam	She wasn't gonna be there.	
9918	objMiriam	Everything's a mess in Delphi too.	
9919	objMiriam	Monsters everywhere...	
9920	objMiriam	And,| you know,|| she's so old...	
9921	objMiriam	When I saw her...	
9922	objMiriam	It got...|| very emotional.	
9923	objMiriam	I'm just not good at that stuff.	
9924	objMiriam	{size .7}Why am I even telling you this...{/size}	
9925	objBard	{}Don't be embarassed!	
9926	objBard	I'm glad she was okay too!	
9927	objMiriam	I felt like such a failure.	
9928	objMiriam	Showing up back home like that.	
9929	objMiriam	Without saving the world.	
9930	objMiriam	But|| she didn't make me feel bad at all.

9943	objBard	But you're my friend!	
9944	objMiriam	I'm not a good friend.	
9945	objBard	Sure you are!	
9946	objMiriam	No...||| I'm not.	
9947	objMiriam	You climbed that mountain by yourself.	
9948	objMiriam	And you had to deal with the Hero.

9950	objBard	{}It really was okay!

10044	objBard	Everyone's important!

10131	objMiriam	...	
10132	objMiriam	I wonder what Saphy will think,

10134	objMiriam	I don't think she'd ever be disappointed in me...	
10135	objMiriam	Or at least,| she'd never show it.	
10136	objBard	Why would she be disappointed?!	
10137	objMiriam	Because I failed.	
10138	objMiriam	That's why.	
10139	objBard	No way!

10403	objHero	You aren't listening to me!	
10404	objHero	Yes,|| she did!	
10405	objHero	Do you see what's behind me?	
10408	objHero	{size 2}It's the Moon Overseer's castle!	
10409	objBard	{size 1}...But I was there earlier,| and...	
10410	objBard	It was way further away...	
10411	objHero	The spirit world is collapsing!	
10413	objHero	3 out of 7 Overseers are dead now...	
10414	objHero	Each one gone makes this world lose stability.	
10415	objHero	It's all shrinking now.	
10416	objHero	Everything is getting closer and closer together...	
10417	objHero	And things are leaking out into our world.	
10418	objHero	Or,| getting squeezed out.	
10419	objHero	This is how it starts.	
10420	objHero	The dark ages that will consume our world...	
10428	objBard	{shake}I DON'T CARE!!!{/shake}	
10429	objBard	{shake .4}You|| didn't have to hurt her!!!	
10430	objBard	How were we supposed to know not to do that???{/shake}	
10431	objHero	That's exactly right.	
10432	objHero	You |{shake}don't{/shake}| know.	
10433	objHero	It's why you shouldn't even |{shake}be{/shake}| here!	
10434	objBard	{shake}WHAT IS GOING ON?!{/shake}	
10435	objHero	It's the Overseers.	
10436	objHero	Their personalities are dying...	
10437	objHero	Their forms are deteriorating...	
10438	objHero	They're turning into animals,| driven by instinct.	
10439	objHero	We have to stop them getting out at any cost now.	
10440	objHero	Didn't think I'd be fighting two Overseers at once!	
10441	objHero	Luckily I have just the thing...	
10442	objHero	{shake}The potion of power!{/shake}	
10443	objHero	Thanks again for getting me this.	
10444	objHero	I knew it would come in handy!	
10445	objBard	{shake .5}Ummm!!!...{/shake}	
10446	objHero	Heh!|| They didn't even notice us...	
10447	objHero	They're fighting over what little space is left...	
			
10448	objMiriam	OK!!!|| Here we go!	
			
10449	objMiriam	Hee|e|e|ere we go!!!	
			
10450	objMiriam	Hey...	
10451	objMiriam	{shake .5}Check it out!!!	
10452	objMiriam	{}I mastered this stupid broom!!!	
10453	objMiriam	{}I got this crappy broom from the shops here!	
10454	objMiriam	And it basically was unrideable...	
10455	objMiriam	{shake .7}But I mastered it!!!{/shake}	
10456	objMiriam	Now I can get us anywhere in the city!	
10457	objMiriam	So we can finally...	
10458	objMiriam	Meet...|| the...	
10459	objMiriam	...	
10460	objMiriam	You met the Queen already,| didn't you.	
10461	objBard	Yes.	
10462	objMiriam	{shake}WELL GREAT{/shake}	
10463	objMiriam	So you got the Overseer song?	
10464	objBard	...||Yeah...	
10465	objMiriam	What's wrong	
10466	objMiriam	What's the problem	
10467	objBard	The war didn't end,| Miriam!	
10469	objBard	Even after we came all this way...	
10470	objBard	We couldn't change anything...	
10471	objMiriam	{shake}*Sigh*	
10472	objMiriam	{}How many times do I have to tell you...	
10473	objMiriam	{shake}THE WORLD IS ENDING!!!	
10474	objMiriam	{/shake}War or no war,|| it doesn't matter!!	
10475	objMiriam	We got the song,| so we have what we need.	
10476	objMiriam	We can meet the Overseer!	
10478	objMiriam	Hop on my broom and let's|| {shake}GO!{/shake}	
10479	objMiriam	Before the invasion!	
10480	objMiriam	...Or you can meet me later.	
10481	objMiriam	If you still have stuff to do.	
10482	objMiriam	I'll mark on your map where to find me.	
10483	objMiriam	But keep it quick!!!	
			
10484	objBard	So...|| are we going to Chaandesh?	
10485	objMiriam	Guess| so.	
10486	objMiriam	We definitely {shake}don't{}| wanna go back to Rulle.	
10487	objMiriam	Since I busted you out of jail,	
10488	objMiriam	We're basically fugitives now...	
10489	objBard	Oh!	
10490	objMiriam	Yeah.	
10491	objMiriam	I told you.	
10493	objMiriam	Rules...	
10494	objMiriam	They gotta be broken.	
			
10495	objMiriam	This is the {wiggle}Sky Temple...{/wiggle}	
10496	objMiriam	The next nexus point.	
10497	objMiriam	People built a whole temple around it,	
10498	objMiriam	But it's the {wiggle}place{/wiggle} that matters,| not really the temple.	
10499	objBard	What's special about the place?	
10500	objMiriam	Never really figured that out either.	
10501	objMiriam	All the nexus points seem to be near natural formations...	
10502	objMiriam	But they're just places where there's a lot of spirit...| stuff...	
10503	objMiriam	Spirit stuff is also kind of everywhere,| and invisible.	
10504	objMiriam	'Cause our world and spirit world are linked.	
10505	objMiriam	But at these places it's stronger,| enough that you can move between them.	
10506	objMiriam	Basically.	
10507	objMiriam	My grandma could probably explain it better.	
10508	objMiriam	Anyway,| it's useless for us for now.	
10509	objMiriam	Overseer song blah blah.	
			
10510	objMiriam	Hey...	
10511	objMiriam	Have you noticed how...| quiet...|| it is...?	
10512	objMiriam	There's no animals or birds here...	
			
10513	objBard	Whoa...!	
10514	objBard	What|| happened here?	
10515	objMiriam	||It looks like a monster attack...	
10517	objBard	Hmmm.	
10519	objBard	Maybe| it's nice!	
10520	objBard	Like the ones in Delphi...	
10521	objMiriam	Yeah, probably||| not...	
10522	objMiriam	Let's be careful around here.	
			
10523	objMiriam	It looked like the wall was there to protect the forest...	
10524	objMiriam	Since the other side got so wrecked.	
10525	objMiriam	But...|| this side got pretty wrecked,| too...	
10526	objBard	They said that other kingdom burned it down,| right?	
10527	objMiriam	This...|| {wiggle}definitely{}| doesn't look like| burning...	
10528	objMiriam	There's something| {glitch .6}weird| going on out here...	
			
10552	objMiriam	Hey!	
10553	objMiriam	I saw that!!	
10554	objMiriam	You were talking in the spirit language...	
10555	objMiriam	{shake .1}Did you meet with the Overseer??{}

11126	objPatrul	They would not be so beautiful,| if they did not...	
11127	objPatrul	This is something Eya understands.

11344	objPenny	Listen.	
11345	objPenny	While I am completely serious about bringing you these beans,	
11346	objPenny	You have to understand that what you are asking	
11347	objPenny	is really stretching the limit of reason here.	
11348	objPenny	You're going to have to pay for all these beans.	
11349	objPenny	You realize that,| right?	
11350	objBard	Yes, and I want more.

11278	objPenny	Well!| If it isn't The Bard of {data_pennybeans} beans.

11281	objBard	That's okay!| I didn't really want them.	
11282	objBard	I also still have no money.	
11283	objPenny	Right.	
			
11294	objPenny	I'm sort of the public face of the crew.

11297	objPenny	Well anyway,| welcome aboard,| or something.	
11298	objPenny	And stay out of the cargo.	
11299	objPenny	You want coffee,| you can talk to Lou in the mess hall.	
11300	objPenny	Being a pirate isn't all fun and games.	
11301	objPenny	We've got a serious business enterprise here.	
11302	objPenny	People pay top dollar for coffee beans,| y'know?	
			
11286	objPenny	It's too bad my part of the song was interrupted...	
11287	objPenny	I had a real showstopper ready,| let me tell ya.	
11288	objPenny	Whatever, I'm over it.|| I've got my coffee now.	
11289	objPenny	We don't do a whole lot of sleeping on this ship.

11291	objPenny	Being a pirate isn't all fun and games.	
11292	objPenny	We've got a serious business enterprise here.	
11293	objPenny	People pay top dollar for coffee beans,| y'know?	
			
11252	objPenny	That was a pretty fantastic freakout you had last night from one coffee.	
11253	objPenny	You wouldn't last a second on our crew|, hah.	
11254	objBard	Well...|| I kind of |{wiggle}am{/wiggle}| on your crew now.	
11255	objBard	Right?	
11256	objPenny	...||I guess.	
11257	objPenny	Normally I do the bean-selling,| but I put Francis on the job today.	
11258	objFrancisco	Please don't call me Francis.	
11259	objFrancisco	I go by Francisco with everyone except Penny here.	
11260	objFrancisco	Because she's a deeply rude person with no respect for anyone.	
11261	objPenny	Thus how I can get him to do my bidding.	
11262	objBard	Are you two|| dating?	
11263	-4	{shake}NO{/shake}	
11264	objPenny	When I was a kid, I thought being a pirate sounded so dang cool.	
11265	objPenny	But you know what I'd like now?	
11266	objPenny	Some nice things.	
11267	objPenny	A comfortable life.	
11268	objPenny	Most pirates don't get that.	
11269	objPenny	That's why I work my butt off for this crew.	
11270	objPenny	I guess I figured as a pirate I'd be finding buried treasure.	
11271	objPenny	But in life,| it turns out the real treasure...	
11272	objBard	Is friendship?	
11273	objPenny	No, coffee beans.	
11274	objPenny	People pay top dollar for this stuff.	
			
11245	objPenny	Captain says we're hunting mermaids now!	
11246	objPenny	You really got him all up in a frenzy.	
11247	objPenny	Almost as bad as that week we switched to espresso.	
11248	objPenny	Hoo boy...	
11249	objPenny	But I guess it's not a bad time to adventure.	
11250	objPenny	Bean sales are going swell.	
11251	objPenny	It'll be like a vacation.	
			
11237	objPenny	Ugh!|| Peh!	
11238	objPenny	That guy was so gross...	
11239	objPenny	Thanks a million for dealing with that.

11233	objPenny	Maybe I'll actually get {data_pennybeans} beans to sweeten the deal!	
11234	objPenny	...Okay,| just kidding again.	
11235	objPenny	We spend a lot of time at sea,| so we don't make many friends...

11543	objPhil	We have elderly,| and kids and qin...	
11544	objPhil	Folks who couldn't do the intense journey with her.	
11545	objPhil	So a few of us stayed back to keep 'em safe.	
11546	objPhil	We're hopin' the King sends back help soon...	
11547	objPhil	It's a lot on our minds,| wayfarer.	
11548	objPhil	S'|why we need nice campfire songs.	
			
11364	objPhil	Beautiful night,| hey?	
11365	objPhil	In honor of our new wayfaring friends,| I'm gonna tell an old tale...	
11366	objPhil	About a wayfarer| and a witch.	
11367	objPhil	They say it happened here in this very forest.	
11368	objPhil	And they say| if you listen real close...	
11369	objPhil	You can hear their old spirits singin' along to it too.	
11370	objPhil	Why not start us off with a G, wayfarer?	
11371	objPhil	{wiggle -1}On the last eve of her travels	
11372	objPhil	Under full moon's twinkling glow	
11373	objPhil	A wayfarer true of heart	
11374	objPhil	Was drawn to a meadow	
11375	objPhil	Where the trees stood still and silent	
11376	objPhil	Watching a maiden twirl the air	
11377	objPhil	Her breath escaped in song	
11378	objPhil	And her soul had been ensnared	
11379	objPhil	{size 2.5}They danced in step	
11380	objPhil	Weightless in time	
11381	objPhil	With nothing left but	
11382	objPhil	Two hearts entwined	
11383	objPhil	{size 1}From that moment on	
11384	objPhil	The witch's magic burned	
11385	objPhil	The spell had been cast	
11386	objPhil	As her love did slowly learn	
11387	objPhil	As each night lingered on	
11388	objPhil	The wayfarer's soul grew thin	
11389	objPhil	Her body faded softly	
11390	objPhil	As the spell pulled her in	
11391	objPhil	{size 2.5}They danced in step	
11392	objPhil	Weightless in time	
11393	objPhil	With nothing left but	
11394	objPhil	Two hearts entwined	
11395	objBard	{}{size 1}Cool song!	
11396	objPhil	Thanks very much,| wayfarer.	
11397	objPhil	We've been singin' it for generations.	
11398	objBard	But...||| it's kinda sad,| too...	
11399	objBard	Why did the witch curse the wayfarer?	
11400	objBard	If they were in love...	
11401	objPhil	Hmmm...	
11402	objPhil	You know...	
11403	objPhil	I never really thought about it!|| Heh...	
11404	objPhil	Guess I always figured...	
11405	objPhil	The witch was some kinda trickster.	
11406	objPhil	Who snatched up the wayfarer's soul...	
11407	objBard	{shake .5}NOOOOOO!!!{/shake}	
11408	objBard	But whyyyyyy?	
11409	objMiriam	Maybe it's just a stupid,| made-up song!	
11410	objMiriam	Who cares why?	
11411	objPhil	Well,|| not totally made up.	
11412	objPhil	Like I said,| it happened in these woods.	
11413	objPhil	And the wayfarer was a girl from Rulle...	
11414	objMiriam	And then her |{wiggle}soul{}|| got |{wiggle}snatched?{}	
11415	objPhil	Well,| that's how the story goes.	
11416	objMiriam	Sounds pretty made up to me.	
11417	objMiriam	Or,| what?	
11418	objMiriam	Do you think witches just...	
11419	objMiriam	Go around...|| snatching |{wiggle}souls?{/wiggle}	
11420	objMiriam	Holy crap,|| do you actually?	
11421	objPhil	No!||| Well...	
11422	objPhil	We aren't used to seeing witches...	
11423	objPhil	It's hard to know sometimes.	
11424	objPing	They're cruel folk,| witches!	
11425	objMiriam	{shake .5}What are you talking about?!	
11426	objPing	{}Where do you think the forest monsters came from?	
11429	objPing	They're soldiers of Chaandesh.	
11430	objPing	Magically created and sent here to attack us...	
11431	objPing	And |{shake .5}destroy our precious forest!{/shake}	
11433	objMiriam	||I didn't know that.	
11434	objPing	They're the reason we've been trapped here...	
11436	objBard	But||| {shake}why???{}	
11437	objPing	That's the scariest thing about Chaandesh!	
11438	objPing	We don't |{shake}KNOW{/shake}| why!	
11439	objPing	But from their actions,| it's clear they hate us!	
11441	objPing	They have no regard for nature,| or our way of life!	
11443	objPing	Tell us this,| witch...	
11444	objPing	You said you had a message for the king.	
11445	objPing	Who's it from?	
11446	objPing	What's the message?	
11447	objBard	It's...||| a secret!	
11448	objBard	But it's something that could end the war!	
11449	objPing	Hmm.	
11450	objPhil	You really think so,| wayfarer?	
11451	objBard	Mhm!	
11452	objPing	I'm sorry...	
11453	objPing	But ||that's just| not possible...	
11455	objPhil	Well,| here's hoping.	
11456	objPhil	{size 1}I think it's startin' to get on in time.	
11457	objPhil	How about we call it for the eve?	
11458	objMiriam	Yeah.	
11459	objMiriam	I think I've had enough of this.	
			
11482	objPhil	Guess you'll be on your way then,| hey?	
11483	objPhil	Sorry if stuff got a little...|| heavy...|| last night.	
11484	objPhil	I want here to be as loving as it can be.	
11485	objPhil	We got enough bad goin' on outside.	
11486	objPhil	Tell the King we said hey.	
11487	objPhil	And...|| if you find anyone who came outta here...	
11488	objPhil	Tell them we're okay too,| yeah?	
11489	objPhil	Do you like our rainbow trees,| wayfarer?	
11490	objPhil	We brought 'em here from Xiatian...	
11491	objPhil	If you go there,| you'll see tons more.	
11492	objPhil	They're a reminder for us to take care of nature.	
11493	objPhil	We might be choppin' trees to build our homes...	
11494	objPhil	But we always plant more where they come from.	
11495	objPhil	We gotta work |{wiggle}together{/wiggle}| with the forest...	
11496	objPhil	Just like with our qin.	
11497	objPhil	That's somethin that means a lot to us in Rulle.	
			
11460	objPhil	Wayfarer!	
11461	objPhil	||It's been a time and a half,| hey?	
11462	objPhil	I'm grateful just to be alive...	
11463	objPhil	After all we and the world went through.	
11464	objPhil	Didn't think I'd ever see the capital again.	
11465	objPhil	And look!|| There's witches here too now.	
11466	objPhil	Everything's changing so fast.	
11467	objPhil	But after so much war,| that's a good thing.	
11468	objPhil	I think I'm ready for some wayfaring of my own.	
11469	objPhil	I'm gonna take my banjo and see the world!	
11470	objPhil	Any way I can,| wayfarer.	
11471	objPhil	Cause there's so much to do,| and so much to see.	
11472	objPhil	So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?	
11473	objPhil	You'll never know if you don't go.	
11474	objPhil	And you'll never shine if you don't glow!	
11475	objPhil	I wanna be like you,| wayfarer.	
11476	objPhil	Travelling the world with a song in my heart...	
11477	objPhil	Making people happy wherever I go...|| Yeah!	
11478	objPhil	Everyone'll know I'm coming by the sound of my banjo.	
11479	objPhil	And they'll call me by a special name...	
11480	objPhil	Like... "That guy Phil,| with the banjo!"||| Yeah.	
11481	objPhil	That's the dream.	
			
11577	objHero	...||They destroyed each other.	
11578	objHero	Guess I didn't need that potion after all!	
11579	objHero	Not much left here now.	
11580	objHero	I guess you can still get your silly song thing,| right?	
11581	objHero	It's going to get much,| much,| much worse from here.	
11582	objHero	Just so you know.	
11583	objHero	The spirit world is almost completely collapsed.	
11584	objHero	I was supposed to kill all the Overseers before this happened...	
11585	objHero	But,| it's too late now.	
11588	objHero	You don't belong in this story.	
			
11589	objPing	Hmmmmmmm|ph.	
11590	objPing	You're both lucky Phil's in charge here.	
11591	objPing	If you are innocent,| I apologize for my aggression.	
11592	objPing	But I have my mother to worry about as well.	
11593	objPing	We can't be too careful these days.	
11594	objPing	So.|| I'll be keeping an eye on you...	
11596	objPing	We're surrounded on all sides by awful dark spirits.	
11597	objPing	{size .7}(And apparently|| questionable travellers...){/size}	
11598	objPing	So getting in and out of this town is|| a nightmare...	
11599	objPing	We're just waiting for the Chaandesh army to follow...	
11600	objPing	We're all very peaceful here.	
11601	objPing	We don't need unruly travellers coming and making a ruckus,	
11602	objPing	You understand?	
11603	objPing	Please respect us and our town.	
11604	objPing	Secret messages...|| witches coming through here...	
11605	objPing	You know how suspicious this all looks?	
11606	objPing	Don't make us traitors to Rulle by housing you...

11628	objProfessor	Most peculiar.	
11629	objProfessor	Well,| you don't need to answer this...

11632	objBard	What?	
11633	objProfessor	{}Of course!	
11634	objProfessor	How rude of me to be so direct.

11636	objProfessor	Us civilians really don't know much,| mind.	
11637	objProfessor	Only theories...|| and rumors...

11648	objProfessor	Are you a student here?	
11649	objProfessor	Heh heh!|...||| "Wink!"	
11650	objProfessor	I'm winking,| of course,| because...

11652	objProfessor	If you have come to learn about magic,	
11653	objProfessor	Well...	
11654	objProfessor	While I admire your pursuit of that knowledge...	
11655	objProfessor	There is not much |{wiggle}you{}| can do with it.	
11656	objProfessor	You are not a witch,| correct?	
11657	objProfessor	Unless you are born with the gift...	
11658	objProfessor	Why are some born with magic,| and some not?	
11659	objProfessor	The answer is not clear to us,| yet.

12215	objSaher	It's cruel.| I hate it.	
12216	objSaher	I came a long way to be safe from the war.	
12217	objSaher	But here I'm an outsider...	
12218	objSaher	And with monsters attacking us now,| I guess it's not safe either.	
12219	objSaher	I can't believe Chaandesh would really send giants...	
12220	objSaher	They're way bigger than the little guys in the forests.	
12221	objSaher	But hey, this whole conflict is crazy.	
12222	objSaher	I think we all want it to be over.	
			
12223	objSaj	Hello...	
12224	objSaj	Are you interested in any potions...?	
12225	objSaj	||I made them all myself...	
12226	objSaj	The science behind it is very interesting...	
12229	objSaj	I source all of my ingredients from nature...	
12230	objSaj	And I apply knowledge from chemistry to make new concoctions...	
12233	objSaj	My potions are high quality...	
12234	objSaj	They produce consistent results...	
12235	objSaj	You should buy some...	
12236	objBard	That sounds fun!	
12237	objBard	I don't have any money,| though.	
12238	objSaj	Oh...	
			
12239	objSaj	Uh...| Hello...	
12240	objSaj	It's you again...	
12241	objBard	We're here for the Potion of Power!	
12242	objSaj	||Wow...	
12243	objSaj	You didn't strike me as| such high rollers...	
12246	objSaj	It will cost quite a few Farquaads...	
12247	objMiriam	Farqu|what?	
12248	objSaj	Um...|?	
12249	objSaj	Farquaads?	
12250	objSaj	As in...| currency...?| Money...?	
12251	objBard	Oh!	
12252	objBard	We don't have any of that...	
12253	objSaj	|Oh...	
12254	objSaj	Well,| in that case...	
12255	objSaj	You can't have it...	
12256	objBard	Ah!	
12257	objBard	Can't we do something for you...| to give it to us?	
12258	objSaj	|Maybe for some of my other potions...	
12259	objSaj	But the Potion of Power is...| very luxurious...	
12260	objSaj	You would need a treasure chest of Farquaads to afford it...	
12262	objMiriam	{shake}AAARRGGH!	
12263	objMiriam	{shake .4}FORGET ABOUT IT!!!	
12264	objMiriam	Me and my grandma used to make potions!	
12265	objMiriam	It's not that hard!	
12266	objMiriam	Screw you and your hoity toity store!!!	
12267	objMiriam	We'll just do it ourselves for way cheaper!!	
12268	objSaj	{}||Okay...	
12269	objMiriam	Let's get out of here, {name}!	
12270	objSaj	|Good luck with your potion brewing...	
12271	objSaj	The Potion of Power can be very tricky to create...	
12272	objSaj	I hope your friend knows what she's doing...	
12273	objSaj	If she does,| actually,| I would love to talk to her...	
12274	objSaj	There aren't many potion enthusiasts here...	
12275	objSaj	Potions are classically thought of as a magical thing...	
12276	objSaj	But,| people in Rulle don't tend to trust magic much...	
12277	objSaj	So,| instead I apply knowledge from chemistry...	
12278	objSaj	I think it makes the potions much better,| actually...	
12279	objSaj	They produce consistent results...	
12280	objSaj	|Your friend isn't a magic user...| is she?	
12281	objSaj	She might run into trouble around here...	
12282	objSaj	|I saw the Hero was in town...	
12283	objSaj	That's very exciting, for a potion brewer like me...	
12284	objSaj	That's someone who could actually afford a Potion of Power...	
12285	objSaj	Um...| no offense...	
			
12286	objVivian	{shake}BOSS!!!{/shake}	
12287	objSandra	You made it back!	
12289	objVivian	We were keeping Chaandesh safe while you were away.	
12290	objSandra	It was tough!	
12291	objSandra	The monsters just got worse and worse...	
12292	objVivian	Tough for regular old witches,| maybe!	
12293	objVivian	{shake}BUT NOT FOR US!!!{/shake}	
12294	objSandra	No,| it really was tough,| though!	
12295	objVivian	Yeah I guess it was pretty tough.	
12296	objSandra	But then,| all at once...	
12297	objSandra	They just...|| vanished!	
12298	objSandra	It was a miracle!	
12299	objVivian	They probably gave up after we fought 'em so hard!	
12300	objSandra	Something really special happened,| I think.	
12301	objSandra	We heard your voice from far,| far away...	
12302	objSandra	Well,| more than just your voice.	
12303	objVivian	It was something huge!	
12304	objVivian	A million voices all at once!	
12305	objVivian	Like that song you sang to the King and Queen...	
12306	objVivian	That's how we knew it was you,| boss!	
12307	objSandra	And all at once,| everyone started singing along!	
12308	objSandra	It felt| really powerful...	
12309	objVivian	Oh yeah!	
12310	objVivian	That reminds me.	
12311	objVivian	You actually||| have a really nice singing voice, San!	
12312	objSandra	Oh!||...| Thanks!	
12313	objSandra	It looks like the war is ending.	
12314	objSandra	So maybe Chaandesh won't need protectors anymore...	
12315	objVivian	Yup!|| It's true!	
12316	objVivian	We were talking about retiring the masks.	
12317	objSandra	I'm ready to just be a regular witch again...	
12318	objVivian	I'm not yet!	
12319	objVivian	We could fight crime,| here at home!!	
12320	objVivian	But I couldn't do it without you, San...	
12321	objSandra	Shucks!	
			
12322	objSanta	...	
12323	objSanta	To think...	
12324	objSanta	That all these years...	
12325	objSanta	The dream I was working toward...	
12326	objSanta	It wasn't successful.	
12327	objSanta	||That's hard...	
12328	objSanta	Maybe it's time	
12329	objSanta	I took a break...	
12330	objSanta	You can go.	
12331	objSanta	I have a lot to think about here.	
12332	objSanta	I'm angry,| but also relieved.	
12333	objSanta	Angry to be told my toys didn't create joy...	
12334	objSanta	But relieved that there were those who would tell me.	
12335	objSanta	I must deeply rethink what it is I'm doing.	
			
12336	objSanta	So||-ho|-ho...	
12337	objSanta	{wiggle}You're{/wiggle}| the one who disrupted my factory.	
12339	objSanta	I'm|| very disappointed in you!

12360	npcs[balalaika]	Everyone in this city is hurt by the factory...

12381	objSanta	I shut down the factory.	
12382	objBard	Just| like that...?	
12383	objSanta	All I wanted| was to bring joy to people.	
12384	objSanta	I thought Happy Kid was finally the answer...	
12385	objSanta	|||But I can see it is not...	
12386	objSanta	Perhaps,| in my absence,| the world changed...

12552	objSavita	What are witches like?	
12553	objBard	Well,| Miriam| is really grumpy all the time.	
12554	objBard	But she's also really cool!	
12555	objBard	One time she fought the Hero!	
12556	objSavita	So she's grumpy all the time,| and she fights the Hero?	
12557	objSavita	I guess that's why everyone hates witches...

13113	objTanya	||It's a bit exciting, innit?

13115	objTanya	Oh,|| a |{wiggle}long{/wiggle}| time...	
13116	objTanya	Don't think he's left the factory for...|| years...	
13117	objTanya	Even the factory boys ain't heard nothing.	
13118	objBeth	I go nuts being stuck here all day.	
13119	objBeth	But that guy...	
13120	objTanya	He could be dead!	
13121	objTanya	How the heck would we even know?	
			
13122	objBard	Do you wanna overthrow the factory?	
13123	objTanya	{shake}Whaaaaaaat???{/shake}	
13124	objTanya	Do you even know what you're saying??	
13125	objTanya	The factory is everything here...	
13126	objTanya	Chismest'd be nothin without it!	
13127	objTanya	Be careful where you say stuff like that...	
13128	objTanya	{wiggle}Well ain't you just a lil sweetheart!{/wiggle}	
13129	objTanya	Something to drink, hon?	
13130	objBard	Like...|| juice?	
13131	objTanya	...	
13132	objTanya	No.	
13133	objTanya	Life's stressful here.	
13134	objTanya	Folks come here to relax after a long day.	
13135	objTanya	Well,| except that one guy.	
13136	objTanya	The whiner who's always crying.	
13137	objTanya	He ain't worked a day in his life,| I think.	
13138	objTanya	Still comes here to relax though.	
13139	objTanya	Can't imagine what's stressing that |{wiggle}slacker{}| out.	
13140	objTanya	You seen that stray dog around town?	
13141	objTanya	She sleeps outside here every night.	
13142	objTanya	Sad, ain't it?| Wish she had a friend...	
13143	objTanya	{wiggle}Well ain't you just a lil sweetheart!{/wiggle}	
13144	objTanya	Something to drink, hon?	
13145	objBard	Like...|| juice?	
13146	objTanya	...	
13147	objTanya	No.	
13148	objTanya	The factory boys are scramblin',| now that it's shut down...	
13149	objTanya	But it's good,| y'know? We all needed change.	
13150	objTanya	Maybe now we can put that energy into making something actually useful.	
13151	objTanya	Just an idea.	
13152	objTanya	You seen those Happy Kid dolls from the factory?	
13153	objTanya	Eya almighty I| am|| {shake}SICK{/shake}| of those dolls!	
13154	objTanya	We got a ban on bringin' them into here.	
13155	objTanya	Not that anyone tries to.	
13156	objTanya	{size .7}I think we're all pretty sick of them...	
13157	objTanya	The Baron's a scary guy!	
13158	objTanya	I mean,| no one ain't never seen him...	
13159	objTanya	Maybe he's |{wiggle}disfigured{/wiggle}|, y'know?	
			
13160	objTelescopenote	There's a note on the door...	
			
13161	objTelescopenote	GONE TO DINER.	
			
13162	objTender	So...| the factory is no more...	
13163	objTender	Perhaps the Baron's heart did change...	
13164	objTender	It's as if a curtain has been lifted,	
13165	objTender	and the infernal machine switched off.	
13166	objTender	Is freedom truly better?|| Now we will see...	
13167	objTender	I wonder what's become of the Baron...	
13168	objTender	If he sets foot outside of that factory,	
13169	objTender	it will be the first time in years...	
			
13170	objBard	Do you want to overthrow the factory?	
13171	objTender	...	
13172	objTender	I thought this question might come someday...	
13173	objTender	Let me say this.	
13174	objTender	The factory may be an evil place.	
13175	objTender	But the Baron is not an evil man.	
13176	objTender	At least,| not when I knew him.	
13177	objTender	It was always his dream to build this empire.	
13178	objTender	...||And I cannot stand against the dream of a friend.	
13179	objTender	This is a city of sad and lost spirits.	
13180	objTender	They march in line,| as if driven by machinery.	
13181	objTender	To see a new face here is|| a pleasant change.	
13182	objTender	The factory here determines the schedule of everything.	
13183	objTender	The flow of people in and out during the day and night...	
13184	objTender	It's the lifeblood of this city.	
13185	objTender	Some say the Baron of the factory is an evil man.	
13186	objTender	But I once knew him as kind and gentle.	
13187	objTender	That was a long time ago...	
13188	objTender	...	
13189	objTender	...Ah.	
13190	objTender	The air is so brisk...	
13191	objTender	...	
13192	objTender	And putrid...	
13193	objTender	I once was friends with the Baron...	
13194	objTender	He left his life behind when the factory grew.	
13195	objTender	He must be very old now.	
13196	objTender	By day,| the workers march into the factory.	
13197	objTender	And by night,| to my pub.	
13198	objTender	Such is the clockwork of this city.	
			
13199	objTiamo	Good day,| citizen!	
13200	objTiamo	Everything in order?	
13201	objTiamo	Seen anything or anyone suspicious in the city?	
13202	objTiamo	Don't hesitate to come to me if so...	
13203	objTiamo	Even if it's someone you know,| okay?	
13204	objTiamo	The military's here to keep us all safe.	
13205	objTiamo	Everyone's excited about the Hero in town,| aren't they?	
13206	objTiamo	Even if she wasn't here,|| we could have stopped those monsters.	
13207	objTiamo	I just want to make sure you know that.	
13208	objTiamo	Xiatian is the safest place in the world.	
13209	objTiamo	But we appreciate her help, of course.	
13210	objTiamo	Us soldiers are all huge fans of the Hero too.	
13211	objTiamo	We're interested in working with her to keep the city safe.	
13212	objTiamo	...||I haven't gotten to meet her yet...	
13213	objTiamo	But I really would like to.

13215	objTina	I'm a teen.	
13216	objTina	I'm supposed to be acting raucous and rebellious.

13510	objUlima	Sweet crunchy batflakes!	
13511	objUlima	Would you like to take some?	
13512	objBard	Nah I'm okay!	
			
13513	objVaruna	Oh,| I don't go here.	
13514	objVaruna	I was just stopping by...	
13515	objVaruna	To deliver my boyfriend some dinner!!!	
13516	objVaruna	I'm an awesome supportive girlfriend!!!	
13517	objVaruna	He's studying hard night and day.	
13518	objVaruna	When you fall into that, it's easy to forget everything.	
13520	objVaruna	Like eating.	
13521	objVaruna	He'd never forget me though.	
13522	objVaruna	He'll become a Grand Witch and we'll get married.	
13523	objVaruna	Yes...|| it's a total dream life!	
13524	objVaruna	These days are the tough ones.	
13525	objVaruna	He's in school,| and I'm busy with work.	
13526	objVaruna	We hardly see each other now.	
13527	objVaruna	But it will all be better in the end!	
13528	objVaruna	Sometimes I worry,	
13529	objVaruna	That the war will reach us here.	
13530	objVaruna	And he'll be called to battle,| as a Grand Witch.	
13531	objVaruna	Our perfect life would be short lived.	
13532	objVaruna	All I can do is hope.	
13533	objVaruna	And keep telling strangers about all my worries.	
13534	objVaruna	Sorry if that's awkward!	
13535	objVaruna	I have a lot on my mind!!!	
			
13536	objViola	Feels good to be back in Delphi!	
13537	objViola	It's the same classless dump as before...	
13538	objViola	But I've gone through a transformation!	
13539	objViola	I played my heart out on the world stage.	
13540	objViola	I've soared like an eagle!	
13541	objViola	Being here reminds me of how far I've come.	
13542	objViola	I have to thank you again...	
13543	objViola	For bringing the band together.	
13544	objViola	Manny's rough around the edges,| but he gets gigs.	
13545	objViola	And Ash is a downer,| but their accordion sings like an angel.	
13546	objViola	And then there's me...	
13547	objViola	We make such a great team together.	
13548	objViola	You'll sing with us again someday too,| won't you?	
13549	objViola	We're having a bit of a comeback tour here.	
13550	objViola	Back in the Crazy Raven again...	
13551	objViola	Oh,| it's so perfectly full circle!	
13552	objViola	And after that,| who knows!	
13553	objViola	It feels like we could go anywhere now.	
13554	objViola	I'm sure we will.	
			
13555	objBard	Do you want to join a band?	
13556	objViola	With you?	
13557	objBard	Yup!	
13558	objBard	And this guy called Manny.	
13559	objViola	{wiggle}Oh{/wiggle}|||...|| Manny,| huh?	
13560	objViola	He's been begging for me to join his band for a {wiggle}loooooong{}| time...	
13562	objViola	But...| if he's got you in there too...	
13563	objViola	This might really |be| something this time,| hmm?	
13564	objViola	Alright|.|.|.||| I'll perform with you.	
13565	objViola	But |{anim sprViola_T_T}{wiggle}I'll{/wiggle}| talk to Manny about this |arrangement.

13568	objViola	Fine.|| But try to keep up this time!	
13569	objBard	Hello?	
13570	objBard	{size .7}(She's...|| ignoring me)	
			
13571	objViola	I haven't played for so many people before.	
13572	objViola	My heart's racing...	
13576	objViola	No more coffee shops for me!	
13577	objViola	It's no surprise so many people came.	
13578	objViola	They must be so excited to see us!	
13579	objViola	Every moment we delay,| the tension rises...	
13580	objViola	Let's not keep those poor people waiting much longer.	
13581	objViola	I'm really going to play my heart out.	
13582	objViola	Nothing in the world feels better...	
			
13583	objViola	Manny and I worked it out.	
13584	objViola	I'm going to play on a real stage...	
13585	objViola	I've been waiting a long time for this.	
13586	objViola	This is going to be my big chance to break out!	
13587	objViola	I hope you're as good on a stage as you are in a coffee shop.	
13588	objViola	Manny's a bit rough around the edges...	
13589	objViola	But he means well.	
			
13592	objViola	Some guy blew a kiss at me while I was playing...	
13593	objViola	And I think he shouted| "I love you!" |or something.	
13594	objViola	I was like|| a |{wiggle}goddess{/wiggle}| to him...	
13595	objViola	I think we really did something special.	
			
13596	objViola	I guess Manny really did it this time...	
13597	objViola	Maybe he's not as bad as I thought.	
13598	objViola	You're leaving me with Manny?	
13599	objViola	I'll miss you.	
			
13602	objViola	That was quite a show!	
13603	objViola	Did you see.|.|.?|| The audience loved me!	
13604	objViola	You all did great too,| of course.	
13605	objViola	Going so soon?

13610	objViola	Huh.	
13611	objViola	You're not |{shake .5}QUITE{}| on my level,| but...

13726	objWhiner	Nobody in this town ever believed in me,| before you.	
13727	objWhiner	But now| it feels like everyone does!	
13728	objWhiner	It's hard,| feeling worthless...	
13729	objWhiner	And it's hard when nobody cares about you.	
13730	objWhiner	Because you can't control if they do.	
13731	objWhiner	But...	
13732	objWhiner	You |CAN control| if you care about other people!	
13733	objWhiner	{dog} gave me someone to care about.	
13734	objWhiner	I'd never had that before...	
13735	objWhiner	But once I did...	
13736	objWhiner	It made me feel so cared for,| too.	
13737	objWhiner	Now that Elara is opening up a lab...

13756	objWhiner	The astronomer seems so smart...	
13757	objWhiner	I didn't think we could actually shut down the factory,

13965	objAngel	I'm not really supposed to tell the hero that	
13966	objAngel	Until like,| the very end

14277	objAngel	hurts	
14278	objAngel	But it's not true!!!	
14279	objAngel	I really didn't lie to you	
14280	objAngel	I swear!	
14281	objAngel	Actually,| I came to tell you	
14282	objAngel	I'm| totally on your team now!	
14283	objBard	{}Huh?	
14284	objAngel	{}{angel}Yeah!	
14285	objAngel	I mean,| you're still definitely not the hero	
14286	objAngel	But that doesn't matter!	
14287	objAngel	You're|| good	
14288	objAngel	And there's still a chance to stop the end of the world	
14289	objAngel	There's still|| one more Overseer...	
14290	objAngel	The one we,| um...|| skipped	
14291	objBard	{}The Dream King?	
14292	objAngel	{}{angel}Yeah!!!	
14293	objAngel	I told Audrey as much...	
14294	objAngel	That|| maybe she should stop...	
14295	objAngel	And give you time to collect the Earthsong	
14296	objAngel	But|| she really didn't like that	
14297	objAngel	one bit	
14298	objBard	{}|Really?	
14299	objAngel	{}{angel}I think...|| she's really scared,| lil b.	
14300	objAngel	When I said she should wait for you...	
14301	objAngel	She acted like...| I was taking somethin from her	
14302	objAngel	I think she |really| wants| to be the hero	
14303	objAngel	Basically no matter what	
14304	objAngel	She's...|| kinda dangerous...	
14305	objAngel	I mean I love you both,| but...	
14307	objAngel	She's gotta be stopped	
14308	objBard	{}Then...|| there's no time to waste!!!	
14309	objAngel	{}{angel}Yes!!!	
14310	objBard	{}We need to hurry!	
14311	objBard	Back to Langtree!	
14312	objAngel	{}{angel}Right!	
14313	objAngel	But,| first...	
14314	objAngel	You gotta collect the King of Hearts' song...	
14315	objBard	{}Right!	
			
14317	objHero	Hmm.	
14318	objHero	That doesn't look good.	
14319	objHero	That thing's just a monster now!	
14320	objHero	It won't listen to us.	
14321	objBard	{shake}NOOO!{/shake}	
14322	objBard	There |{shake}has{/shake}| to be a way!	
14323	objHero	There might be!	
14324	objHero	{shake .5}If...{/shake}	
14325	objHero	You let me hit it with lightning.	
14326	objHero	That'll stun it...	
14327	objHero	And then you'd be able to get close.	
14328	objBard	Will that hurt him?	
14329	objHero	Yes.	
14330	objBard	...	
14331	objBard	{shake 2}HMFLCUGHHLCMQLGMV!!!	
14332	objHero	{}?	
14333	objBard	{shake}FINE!{/shake}	
14334	objBard	But...	
14335	objBard	Only because||| I want to help him!	
14336	objBard	Please don't do more than you have to...	
			
14337	objHero	Pretty good entrance,| right?	
14338	objHero	What do you think?||| Too much?	
14339	objHero	Stunned silence!|| Got it.	
14340	objHero	Looks like you're in a real pickle here.	
14341	objHero	Lost on a mountain...|| Giant monster...	
14342	objHero	Really calls for a {wiggle}|Hero,|{/wiggle} don't you think?	
14343	objHero	Wow,| you're really no fun this time.	
14344	objHero	I guess that's fine!	
14345	objHero	Let's make this fast,| shall we?	
14346	objHero	I'd say it's finally time...	
14347	objHero	To unleash my secret weapon!	
14348	objHero	{shake}The potion of power!{/shake}	
14349	objHero	Fitting,| don't you think?	
14350	objHero	This is the one you got for me...	
14351	objHero	And now it's gonna save your life!	
14353	objBard	Oh no,| wait...!!!	
14354	objHero	Spare me the theatrics!	
14355	objHero	You aren't seriously still trying...	
14356	objHero	To stop me from killing monsters,| are you?	
14357	objBard	No,| that's not it...!!!	
			
14358	objXia	I'm sorry my son gave you trouble.	
14359	objXia	Ignore him.|| He's a fool.	
14360	objXia	You and your friend seem perfectly nice to me...	
14361	objXia	It's true that the forest has gotten very dangerous.	
14362	objXia	I've been trapped in this sorry town for who knows how long.	
14363	objXia	I'll probably die here too.	
14364	objPing	{quake}{shake}MOTHER!!!!	
14365	objPing	{}Don't speak like that...	
14366	objXia	At one point a very tough girl came through here...	
14367	objXia	And for a time she kept us safe.	
14368	objXia	But of course,| as soon as she left,| things became terrible again.	
14369	objXia	All the while,| my idiot son hasn't helped anyone...	
14370	objXia	Even some person with a sword is tougher than my son.	
14371	objXia	Pathetic,| isn't it?	
14372	objPing	{quake}{shake}MOTHER!!!!	
14373	objPing	{}That was the hero of legend...	
14374	objPing	How am I supposed to be as strong as |{wiggle}she{}| is?	
14375	objXia	Hero,| legend,| who gives a hoot!	
14376	objXia	You'd be strong too if you weren't so lazy!	
			
14377	objYonni	Step right up!	
14378	objYonni	Why not look here for some hot new threads?	
14379	objYonni	That outfit is cute,| but maybe it's a bit dated?	
14380	objYonni	You'll find something you love here!	
14381	objYonni	The people of Mohabumi have the best fashion in the world!	
14382	objYonni	Ask anybody!|| We're famous for it.	
14383	objYonni	Don't you want to look fabulous,| too?	
14384	objYonni	Your little feather cap is the |definition| of cute!	
14385	objYonni	Where did you get it?	
14386	objBard	Oh!|| Thanks!	
14387	objBard	I made it,| actually!	
14388	objYonni	Huh!	
14389	objBard	I found the feather first,| and thought it was really cool!	
14390	objBard	So I wanted something to put it in...	
14391	objYonni	Uh huh.| Uh huh.	
14392	objBard	I'm not super good at sewing,	
14393	objBard	So I got my friend Marley to help...	
14394	objYonni	Uh huh.| Uh huh.| Uh huh.	
14395	objYonni	What a great story!	
14396	objBard	Wait!| I wasn't done!	
14397	objYonni	Oh.	
14398	objBard	See,| cause then,|| we had to find the fabric!	
14399	objBard	We lived in a small town,| so it was hard to come by!	
14400	objBard	Blah blah blah blah blah!	
14401	objBard	And that's how we made it!	
14402	objYonni	|||Great.	
14403	objYonni	Well,| uh,| if you wanna buy anything...	
14404	objYonni	You can do that...	
			
14405	objYuna	That song was so catchy...	
14406	objYuna	Now it's stuck in my head.	
14407	objYuna	I'm kinda angry about it,| actually.	
14408	objYuna	I want it to stop.	
14409	objYuna	I guess there's this shop here...	
14410	objYuna	All this foresty stuff has a nice smell...	
14411	objYuna	Maybe I'll get it to help me relax...	
14412	objYuna	I don't know why,|| but I feel worried almost all the time...	
14413	objYuna	back	
14414	objYuna	I wish I could just turn it off.	
14415	objYuna	Maybe it's the war...|| maybe not...	
14416	objYuna	The Chaandesh really scare me.	
14417	objYuna	I know they all use magic and stuff...	
14418	objYuna	I don't want people like that as an enemy.	
14419	objYuna	Did you see the giant monsters they sent here?	
14420	objYuna	Someone told me they ate| anything and everything.	
14421	objYuna	Plants,| rocks,| animals,| walls,| houses...	
14422	objYuna	||{wiggle .5}People...{}	
14423	objYuna	Even when I forget about the war...	
14424	objYuna	I still feel| terrible...	
14425	objYuna	Like something bad is coming...| and big...	
14426	objYuna	Sometimes the feeling is especially bad.	
14427	objYuna	And the only thing that shakes me out of it	
14428	objYuna	...|is talking to my mom.	
14429	objYuna	|She's the best.	
			
14430	objYuu	Hi there,| cutie.	
14431	objYuu	You look so helpless and adorable.	
14432	objYuu	Are you lost?	
14433	objBard	Nope, I totally am not!!	
14434	objYuu	If you say so.	
14435	objYuu	I'm from far away too.	
14436	objYuu	I'm an adventurer,| you might say.	
14437	objBard	Oh,| that's cool!	
14438	objBard	I'm also an adventurer!	
14439	objYuu	{wiggle}{shake .2}Hehehe!||{} I bet you are!	
14440	objYuu	How's your adventure been so far?	
14441	objBard	Ummm...|| good...?	
14442	objBard	You know,| really like,| epic,|| and stuff...	
14443	objYuu	Fight lots of big monsters?	
14444	objBard	...	
14445	objYuu	You don't have to impress me.	
14446	objYuu	You're so cute as you are.|| Really.	
14447	objYuu	Good luck on your adventure,| {wiggle}cutie...{/wiggle}	
			
14448	objYuu	Ooh la la!	
14449	objYuu	Everyone's buzzing about a fancy new hero...	
14450	objYuu	Who's going to bring back the mermaids!	
14451	objYuu	That's you,| isn't it?	
14452	objYuu	I've been on some adventures myself.	
14453	objYuu	But,| if you find the mermaids...	
14454	objYuu	You'd be the greatest in the sea!	
14455	objYuu	Good luck...	
			
14456	objYuu	You're the mermaid hero,| aren't you?	
14457	objYuu	You came back!	
14458	objYuu	Our mermaid hero!	
14459	objYuu	You're back!	
			
14460	objYuu	Are|| the mermaids coming back,| too?	
14461	objBard	No...	
14462	objYuu	Awww!	
14463	objYuu	That's okay!!	
14464	objYuu	You look so down about it...	
14465	objYuu	I can't stand it!	
14466	objYuu	You're just too cute!	
14467	objYuu	Please cheer up!	
14468	objYuu	Who needs mermaids,| anyway?	
14469	objBard	You really don't care?	
14470	objYuu	{shake}NAAA{/shake}aaaah!!!	
14471	objYuu	I just wanted an excuse to talk to you.	
14472	objYuu	Thinking about someone like you,	
14473	objYuu	On an adventure across the sea...	
14474	objYuu	Adorable!	
14475	objYuu	It's too much!	
14476	objBard	Ha ha!	
14477	objBard	I really am a big time hero though.	
14478	objBard	I found the Mermaid's Tear!	
14479	objBard	And I met the mermaids!	
14480	objBard	They just...	
14481	objBard	Didn't want to come back.	
14482	objYuu	Awww.	
14483	objYuu	Well,| maybe next time!	
			
		DEV COMMENTARY, UNLOCKED AFTER BEATING THE GAME	
2298	objCommentary	After the game systems were kinda working,	
2299	objCommentary	The first thing I made was the intro.	
2300	objCommentary	But the original intro was really bad.	
2301	objCommentary	A star landed by the bard's house,| and you walked to it up a hill...	
2302	objCommentary	(A lot like in Earthbound...)	
2303	objCommentary	And then the angel gave you a spiel about the world ending	
2304	objCommentary	It was just very...|| plain...	
2305	objCommentary	It didn't change until I finished Act 1,| and this new idea came to me all at once.	
2306	objCommentary	I think it expresses the values of the game pretty concisely.	
2307	objCommentary	And it cemented how huge a part the Hero would have to play in the story.	
2308	objCommentary	Until then,| I was undecided on her role.	
2309	objCommentary	You'd be surprised how little this changed from my first design.	
2310	objCommentary	A bird,| singing 3 notes,| with the two ledges...	
2311	objCommentary	But there were a million tiny changes to make it work	
2312	objCommentary	The bird animations,| the UI,| the notes it sings...	
2313	objCommentary	The note detection,| the spacing,| the timing...	
2314	objCommentary	It took |MANY| tries and tests and adjustments for players to understand this puzzle.	
2315	objCommentary	This is maybe the most crucial screen in the game...	
2316	objCommentary	It's the first real test of all the game controls...	
2317	objCommentary	It sets the pace for all the puzzles and gameplay to come...	
2318	objCommentary	And it solidifies the idea of "musical gameplay" in the player's mind	
2319	objCommentary	It was important to establish early on that you could sing melodies.	
2320	objCommentary	The ghost fights reinforce that too.	
2321	objCommentary	Later on,| the gameplay gets more abstract...	
2322	objCommentary	But the player always understands that they're singing songs.	
2323	objCommentary	I decided I needed to put something interactable on this ledge...	
2324	objCommentary	So the player would jump up to it,| and learn how layers worked.	
2325	objCommentary	At the time Miriam was one of the only other characters designed.	
2326	objCommentary	I didn't yet know her story,| or how far she'd go.	
2327	objCommentary	But I had some ideas on the spot,| wrote some lines and stuck her here.	
2328	objCommentary	I don't think I've edited them since!	
2329	objCommentary	Most of Act 1 was rewritten many times,| in contrast.	
2330	objCommentary	But Miriam had a clear voice right away.	
2331	objCommentary	I love Clyde.	
2332	objCommentary	I named Langtree after "Langtry,"	
2333	objCommentary	Which is a tiny tiny town in Texas that I slept in on my bike trip.	
2334	objCommentary	It's in the middle of the desert,| far from civilization...	
2335	objCommentary	It used to be a rail town,| but trains don't go there anymore.	
2336	objCommentary	And there were only a few people living there.	
2337	objCommentary	But they remarked about how they loved the peace and solitude.	
2338	objCommentary	I thought that was inspiring.	
2339	objCommentary	The town itself was named after an old famed actress named Lillie Langtry,	
2340	objCommentary	And she was |ALSO| the namesake of Miss Langtry,| the lovestruck schoolteacher,	
2341	objCommentary	In "Over the Garden Wall,"| one of this game's biggest creative inpirations.	
2342	objCommentary	I didn't know that until later.	
2343	objCommentary	But there's something full circle about it,| isn't there?	
2344	objCommentary	It seems like the ghosts are just singing random patterns...	
2345	objCommentary	But I actually hand-wrote every 3 note sequence that sounded right.	
2346	objCommentary	I also seperated them into hard and easy patterns...	
2347	objCommentary	If you wait a while,| the ghosts start doing more easy ones.	
2348	objCommentary	We added dancing very late in development.	
2349	objCommentary	I was animating them up until the last few weeks.	
2350	objCommentary	And it took a long time to realize the Mask would teach them.	
2351	objCommentary	Until then,| he was just a sagely character who mysteriously appeared everywhere...	
2352	objCommentary	It was a good moment where two disconnected ideas completed one another.	
2353	objCommentary	This puzzle was a doozy to make work for players.	
2354	objCommentary	It tests very particular knowledge about how the game elements interact.	
2355	objCommentary	I came back late in development and added more screens prior to this,	
2356	objCommentary	Just to really reinforce everything at play here.	
2357	objCommentary	I think it's a fun puzzle.	
2358	objCommentary	...|But I'm still not 100% sure if it was right to include in this game	
2359	objCommentary	What do you think?	
2360	objCommentary	Early on I thought there would be many more puzzles like this.	
2361	objCommentary	There's a great feature I never got to make use of,| actually...	
2362	objCommentary	Multiple birds can follow you,| and each give you 1 big jump.	
2363	objCommentary	So there could have been a screen,| where,| for example...	
2364	objCommentary	You have to run around and collect birds without jumping...	
2365	objCommentary	And then climb a really tall tower with a chain of bird jumps.	
2366	objCommentary	Sounds fun on paper!	
2367	objCommentary	But I slowly learned this game was more fun when it was less "brainy."	
2368	objCommentary	This song was originally written for the prologue.	
2369	objCommentary	But we came back and replaced it with the Hero melody when that was written.	
2370	objCommentary	It fits way better here,| anyway!	
2371	objCommentary	Also,| this screen was totally based on the one at the end of Wind Waker...	
2372	objCommentary	Where Zelda is sleeping in a bed like this,| just before you fight Ganon.	
2373	objCommentary	I think it's really funny to image the Dream King as a sleeping princess.	
2374	objCommentary	And this ended up being the reference for our final boss room,| too.	
2375	objCommentary	I first envisioned the Dream King as a big fluffy friendly cat.	
2376	objCommentary	Kind of a "My Neighbor Totoro" vibe...	
2377	objCommentary	That would have been so boring though.	
2378	objCommentary	When I first considered that he'd turn you down...| I got very excited.	
2379	objCommentary	Although I didn't fully know what it would mean,| yet.	
2380	objCommentary	Also...	
2381	objCommentary	Did you know you can come back and ring the bell again after he kicks you out?	
2382	objCommentary	I really enjoyed making this screen.	
2383	objCommentary	The idea to name the bard here was something I decided on the spot,	
2384	objCommentary	After it came up organically in the conversation.	
2385	objCommentary	I decided at some point the bard's canon name would be "Kiwi,"	
2386	objCommentary	After a novelty tea called "Kiwi's Big Adventure," which I almost named the game after.	
2387	objCommentary	So I made sure that was a possibility...| along with others.	
2388	objCommentary	Miriam is the only one who refers to you by your chosen name though.	
2389	objCommentary	In fact...|!!!|| Did you know...?	
2390	objCommentary	No two characters refer to you by same name.	
2391	objCommentary	It's true!	
2392	objCommentary	I had a lot of fun coming up with different nicknames for you.	
2393	objCommentary	Delphi is named after Philadelphia,| the city where I grew up.	
2394	objCommentary	I really love Philly.| It's a special place.	
2395	objCommentary	It also inspired the autumn colors and some of the personalities.	
2396	objCommentary	Manny really feels like a Philly guy to me.	
2397	objCommentary	There's a musician I like very much called Slow Magic.	
2398	objCommentary	He was the first inspiration for the Mask character...	
2399	objCommentary	And I was at one of his concerts when I had the plot idea for Act 2.	
2400	objCommentary	A great concert really does set your soul on fire.	
2401	objCommentary	Viola was the first character I designed for the game after the bard.	
2402	objCommentary	The name is pretty on the nose,| isn't it?	
2403	objCommentary	I think I just named her game object after the instrument she was holding.	
2404	objCommentary	As a "temporary" thing until I came up with a name.	
2405	objCommentary	You see where that got us.	
2406	objCommentary	I think she would laugh about it if you mentioned it to her.	
2407	objCommentary	{font 3}"Mhm!|| That's how you know I was born to perform!"	
2409	objCommentary	Ash was designed by my very good friend Noel Berry.	
2410	objCommentary	Used with his permission...	
2411	objCommentary	But I don't think he even remembers making them.	
2412	objCommentary	They were the lead character in an "Inktober" serial comic we were making together.	
2413	objCommentary	It opened with them playing music to their mentor's gravestone,	
2414	objCommentary	And their mentor's ghost rose from the grave and joined in.	
2415	objCommentary	I thought that was a powerful scene...	
2416	objCommentary	So I lifted that too ;)	
2417	objCommentary	As a dog might say,	
2418	objCommentary	Getting the performance working was pretty...|| "Ruff!"	
2419	objCommentary	I wanted the player to feel like they were leading the song.	
2420	objCommentary	And that also meant not enforcing any particular rhythm on their gameplay!	
2421	objCommentary	There couldn't be a failure state,| or any way to "miss."	
2422	objCommentary	I was adamant about this!	
2423	objCommentary	It basically meant the song needed a million layers.	
2424	objCommentary	It responds to you,| and sounds right regardless of what you do.	
2425	objCommentary	It did not come easy for us.	
2426	objCommentary	I remember I was on the phone with Gord,| sorting out all the pieces we needed.	
2427	objCommentary	It was a very frazzled phone call.	
2428	objCommentary	I promised him, "we just need to do this once, and never again."	
2429	objCommentary	We simply couldn't make this game without something like this segment.	
2430	objCommentary	It fulfills the promise of Wandersong.	
2431	objCommentary	We called this song "Wannabe" internally.| I wrote it!	
2432	objCommentary	A few songs were made that way.	
2433	objCommentary	I wrote something simple,| then Gord would spice it up and build on it.	
2434	objCommentary	After Gord did this version,| we decided to make it the Hero's theme.	
2435	objCommentary	There's something apt about the bard introducing it as their breakout musical number,	
2436	objCommentary	Where they finally reveal their true desires...	
2437	objCommentary	Only to have it stolen from them by the actual Hero.| Ouch!	
2438	objCommentary	After that,| we went back and hid this song in the prologue too.	
2439	objCommentary	It's intentional that you hear this one before even the bard's theme.	
2440	objCommentary	Act 2's all about wind.	
2441	objCommentary	In the beginning,| with the troll,| you sing against it.	
2442	objCommentary	Then,| with the band,| you sing with it.	
2443	objCommentary	And then in the spirit world,| you guide it yourself!	
2444	objCommentary	{shake}I |||LOVE||| PIRATES	
2445	objCommentary	This color palette was inspired by Mango and Melon-flavored Melona bars,	
2446	objCommentary	Which I ate all summer while making this act.	
2447	objCommentary	They're super sweet and creamy ice cream bars from Korea.	
2448	objCommentary	The first time I had them,	
2449	objCommentary	My first reaction was anger.	
2450	objCommentary	I was already in my 20s and I'd wasted so much time not eating them.	
2451	objCommentary	You know,| in the game Earthbound...	
2452	objCommentary	(One of my very favorite games ever...)	
2453	objCommentary	In the english translation,| they replaced a bar with a coffee shop.	
2454	objCommentary	And all the adults talk about how you're too young for "coffee,"| etc.	
2455	objCommentary	I wanted to run farther with that idea.	
2456	objCommentary	No rum for these pirates!| They're all about coffee!	
2457	objCommentary	I think it's a good message for the kids.	
2458	objCommentary	But coffee also keeps you alert through the dark ocean night!	
2459	objCommentary	And it's a very valuable crop to sell!	
2460	objCommentary	It really makes sense,| doesn't it?	
2461	objCommentary	In high school,| I made a freeware JRPG about pirates called "Dubloon"	
2462	objCommentary	It's still out there on the internet...	
2463	objCommentary	Anne the bomb girl and the dancing monkey are both from there.	
2464	objCommentary	According to the game lore,	
2465	objCommentary	The monkey may actually house the spirit of a legendary and powerful pirate.	
2466	objCommentary	They were the team spellcaster and could do all kinds of crazy magic.	
2467	objCommentary	Actually,| I've just decided that in Wandersong that's canon.	
2468	objCommentary	Yes.	
2469	objCommentary	For my birthday one year,| my mom drew me a Wandersong fan art.	
2470	objCommentary	The bard was singing,| and the sun was smiling and shining down on them,	
2471	objCommentary	And in a nearby lake,| a fish was singing along too.	
2472	objCommentary	I put her little fish in the game...| it was too good.	
2473	objCommentary	Thanks mom!	
2474	objCommentary	Calliope was designed for my previous game,| Coin Crypt.	
2475	objCommentary	She was a {wiggle}necromancer...{/wiggle}| nya ha ha ha!	
2476	objCommentary	Kat Angeloni,| who did the audio for Coin Crypt,	
2477	objCommentary	Came back to reprise her role for this game.	
2478	objCommentary	This act is all about space.	
2479	objCommentary	I knew you'd have lots of locations to travel to by boat...	
2480	objCommentary	But I didn't have the idea for the sailing screen until the very last moment.	
2481	objCommentary	I was |THIS| close to making a menu screen for it!	
2482	objCommentary	I even started coding it a little before I caught myself and was like,	
2483	objCommentary	{shake}"Wait,| what am I doing???"{/shake}	
2484	objCommentary	Can you imagine how boring that would have been?	
2485	objCommentary	I had envisioned a scene where the bard comes into this salty pirate bar,	
2486	objCommentary	And then wins them over with a jaunty song!	
2487	objCommentary	And teaches them the values of silliness and joy!!!	
2488	objCommentary	It's a classic scene from lots of "naive character on a journey" films.	
2489	objCommentary	But I struggled with how to make it work with the plot.	
2490	objCommentary	So I toned it down...| if you sang here,| the pirates would sing along.	
2491	objCommentary	I even wrote lyrics for them to sing!	
2492	objCommentary	It was how you discovered the location of one of the islands.	
2493	objCommentary	But players were |NOT| organically finding it...	
2494	objCommentary	So |THEN,| I decided it would be |OPTIONAL!	
2495	objCommentary	And no lyics!| Those weren't working well either.	
2496	objCommentary	So just,| if you sang in this room,| the characters would react and sing as well.	
2497	objCommentary	But by then the rest of the game was almost done,	
2498	objCommentary	And it was too much work to record that voiceover for something optional.	
2499	objCommentary	It was maybe the only silly feature Em ever talked me down from.	
2500	objCommentary	And,| it was a good call.	
2501	objCommentary	||But I still wonder what could have been...	
2502	objCommentary	My friend Chevy Ray helped me code the collisions early on...	
2503	objCommentary	Using some...| dark,| twisted math...|| I don't even remember how it works.	
2504	objCommentary	But it's in there,| all right.	
2505	objCommentary	It's the dark magic that lets you collide smartly with |ANY| shape.	
2506	objCommentary	After I had it working,| I went wild.	
2507	objCommentary	The wheels that spin when you sing were one of the first things I tried.	
2508	objCommentary	But I made the spinning wheel itself huge and solid...	
2509	objCommentary	Like spinning a huge revolving door.	
2510	objCommentary	It was kinda fun,| but so,| SO| janky.	
2511	objCommentary	Now it lives here,| as the control method for a totally different thing.	
2512	objCommentary	It's like Zelda!	
2513	objCommentary	Wandersong doesn't usually arrange puzzles so obviously like this,	
2514	objCommentary	Outside of the spirit world.	
2515	objCommentary	But this area of the game feels very "puzzle-y" in a classically gamey way.	
2516	objCommentary	I wanted the player to feel like they were stepping into a new world,| kind of.	
2517	objCommentary	The Hero's world...	
2518	objCommentary	I had the idea for this on the spot.	
2521	objCommentary	I don't know exactly where it came from.	
2522	objCommentary	But as soon as I had the idea,| I knew I had to do it.	
2523	objCommentary	And I had |SO| much fun asking Gord to make a chiptune ska song.	
2524	objCommentary	We spent a day listening to cheesy 90's ska together and getting inspired.	
2525	objCommentary	I think this really exemplifies the best aspects of Wandersong.	
2526	objCommentary	I made a lot of the game in a free-flowing way,| screen by screen,	
2527	objCommentary	Making things up as I went and trying to surprise myself.	
2528	objCommentary	That's the kind of energy indie games naturally tap into.	
2529	objCommentary	But,| later in the game this style of process created a lot of hindrances...	
2531	objCommentary	The idea for this puzzle was sketched very early into my first notes.	
2532	objCommentary	I think it was one of those things this game just had to do at some point.	
2533	objCommentary	But I had to be very patient to use it.	
2534	objCommentary	Act 1 and 2 tend to take things slowly...	
2535	objCommentary	But at this point the player was finally ready for this kind of thing.	
2536	objCommentary	Now the roots were set.	
2537	objCommentary	After this,| it felt like I was allowed to do anything with the singing.	
2538	objCommentary	Markus is just,| like...	
2539	objCommentary	What if toxic masculinity was fully self aware,| and still wanted to be itself?	
2540	objCommentary	I've known people like this...| it's not pretty.	
2541	objCommentary	But it felt right to slot in Act 3,| the act of heroes and quests.	
2542	objCommentary	I think there's something inherently destructive in the "hero quest" mentality...	
2543	objCommentary	At least in the way I see it applied in media these days.	
2544	objCommentary	Hmmm...| I'm getting a bit off the rails here.	
2545	objCommentary	There's actually 3 different ways to "win" this situation.	
2546	objCommentary	I originally only intended the one where you drink coffee and sing Markus off.	
2547	objCommentary	I took so much time to introduce that at the start of the act!	
2548	objCommentary	But then I kept finding other interesting interactions.	
2549	objCommentary	Also,| I should have reminded the player sometime about the coffee thing...	
2550	objCommentary	I think that's a Checkhov's gun storytelling rule I messed up on.	
2551	objCommentary	I started making the footsteps sounds with my mouth while animating the captain's walk.	
2552	objCommentary	And then I knew.|| It was just too good.|| It HAD to be the sound.	
2553	objCommentary	I'm so grateful to have worked on a game where I was allowed to do this.	
2554	objCommentary	Actually,| I feel that way about a lot of this game.	
2555	objCommentary	Speaking of toxic masculinity and its relationship to quests and heroes...	
2556	objCommentary	Captain Lucas is the total epitome of that entanglement,| isn't he?	
2557	objCommentary	He saw a beautiful woman like,| once...	
2558	objCommentary	And now he's on a quest for her love,| like it's a prize to win,| and he HAS to have her...	
2559	objCommentary	Gross,| right???	
2560	objCommentary	But when she turns him down,| at least he has the grace to back off.	
2561	objCommentary	In the long run,| he cares about her desires as much as his own.	
2562	objCommentary	That makes him more redeemable than Markus.	
2563	objCommentary	I really enjoy how the visual design of this place came out.	
2564	objCommentary	I made the background trying to imitate the loading screen visuals in Splatoon...	
2565	objCommentary	The background was supposed to look bubbly and liquid-y...	
2566	objCommentary	But I never figured it out.	
2567	objCommentary	I liked how this looked,| though.	
2568	objCommentary	Later on,| when I needed a background effect for dead Overseers,	
2569	objCommentary	I decided to just re-use this one!	
2570	objCommentary	It has a good "ominous" feeling.	
2571	objCommentary	Before you make something new,| you should always think about what you can re-use!	
2572	objCommentary	I think that's a great rule of thmb.	
2573	objCommentary	Act 3 was supposed to be about waves,| and space.	
2574	objCommentary	The idea loosely translated into changing the shape of these things...	
2575	objCommentary	As a way of kinda "distorting space."	
2576	objCommentary	The shapes are actually totally defined by sinewaves too.	
2577	objCommentary	In the level editor,| they're all identical objects,	
2578	objCommentary	With unique wave offsets and periods and amplitudes written in.	
2579	objCommentary	Act 3 is also about chaos.	
2580	objCommentary	I wanted these things to be confusing and inconsistent.	
2581	objCommentary	So you had to just sing randomly at them and guess what shape they'd take.	
2582	objCommentary	The notes on the player wheel are random,| too.	
2583	objCommentary	(Or semi-random...| there's a pattern guiding how the notes are picked.)	
2584	objCommentary	This whole section is meant to be a bit frustrating.	
2585	objCommentary	It doesn't feel "made for you."	
2586	objCommentary	Because the bard is beginning to feel out of place...	
2587	objCommentary	Like they don't belong here.	
2588	objCommentary	This section was a HUGE amount of effort,| especially for how small it is.	
2589	objCommentary	{shake}TOTALLY WORTH IT THOUGH!{/shake}	
2590	objCommentary	I'd been looking forward to this for a very long time.	
2591	objCommentary	I really thought a lot about Audrey's gameplay...	
2592	objCommentary	I wanted it to be strong enough to believably support an entire other game.	
2593	objCommentary	And then give the player just a tiny slice of that game.	
2594	objCommentary	Down to the tiny touches in her physics,| Audrey is a different beast for sure.	
2595	objCommentary	Did you know she even has a dash/dodge manuever?	
2596	objCommentary	I did give some thought to what the larger game structure would be for this.	
2597	objCommentary	I imagine Audrey could fight the Overseers in any order,| like Mega Man.	
2598	objCommentary	But as time passes,| they're all getting bigger and stronger.	
2599	objCommentary	So each one she fights is always stronger than the last.	
2600	objCommentary	I really didn't want to do any more of this gameplay than necessary.	
2601	objCommentary	But I sure was tempted.	
2602	objCommentary	There are so many ways I could have built on it...	
2603	objCommentary	I really enjoy the mechanic of hitting projectiles with the sword,	
2604	objCommentary	And aiming them different directions based on the angle you hit it at.	
2605	objCommentary	I thought about hiding a golf game using that somewhere...	
2606	objCommentary	{}From concept to final execution,| Act 4 changed the most by a very long shot.	
2607	objCommentary	I always knew it would be about the bard overcoming sadness.	
2608	objCommentary	But the original setting was a tiny,| tiny village in the snow.	
2609	objCommentary	It was going to be a lot more "holiday" themed...| fairy lights everywhere...	
2610	objCommentary	And the bard was going to be cheered up by the holiday spirit!!!	
2611	objCommentary	I always had in mind that this act would have a "time" theme.	
2612	objCommentary	But I had no idea how that would translate into the town gameplay.	
2613	objCommentary	That is,| until Stardew Valley came out,| just as I was starting Act 4.	
2614	objCommentary	I could never get into it,| myself...	
2615	objCommentary	But once I'd thought about scheduled gameplay, I couldn't get it out of my head.	
2616	objCommentary	It was just such a weird,| out of left field,| pie-in-the-sky idea...	
2617	objCommentary	I had to try it.	
2618	objCommentary	It ended up being the most unnecessarily complicated thing in the entire game.	
2619	objCommentary	Writing a day/night NPC schedule is not,| like...||| easy.	
2620	objCommentary	And I did it all just for one tiny piece of this game!!!	
2621	objCommentary	Right after I made an entire action game section!!!	
2622	objCommentary	I hope it at least made an impact...	
2623	objCommentary	I had no idea Peter was going to be in love with Miriam until I wrote his first conversation.	
2624	objCommentary	And then it just seemed...| obvious,| for some reason.	
2625	objCommentary	I also had no idea Miriam was going to reciprocate until I wrote |HER| conversation.	
2626	objCommentary	I was on a rollercoaster,| right there with the player on this one.	
2627	objCommentary	We use the "whisper" singing voice in lots of places in the game...	
2628	objCommentary	But Act 4 is the actual reason we went through with recording it.	
2629	objCommentary	It was not easy!	
2630	objCommentary	We asked a lot of our performer,| John Robert Matz.	
2631	objCommentary	And he really came through!	
2632	objCommentary	This act has so much more power for it.	
2633	objCommentary	The bard losing their singing voice is a loss you can really feel.	
2634	objCommentary	This bit was one of the few big ideas I had very early on.	
2635	objCommentary	But I thought it would be in a kind of lighthearted Santa's toy shop.	
2636	objCommentary	All the elves would be depressed,| and unable to make toys...	
2637	objCommentary	But the bard would run around and cheer them up,| one by one.	
2638	objCommentary	And they'd sing along,| and activate musical toy-making machines,	
2639	objCommentary	Building up the song to a huge joyful power ballad!	
2640	objCommentary	A lot of this act's premise came about to build up to that gameplay.	
2641	objCommentary	But wow,| the vibe of this whole act shifted a lot under that idea.	
2642	objCommentary	It took me a long time to sort that out.	
2643	objCommentary	So this particular section actually changed a lot right at the end.	
2644	objCommentary	For most of development,| everyone in the factory started out not working,	
2645	objCommentary	And when the bard "activated" them,| they'd start working the machines.	
2646	objCommentary	Which made,| uh...|| no sense at all.	
2647	objCommentary	I'm glad I had time to revisit it again.	
2648	objCommentary	This is the only remains of the original "holiday" idea I had for Act 4.	
2649	objCommentary	It's hard to overstate just how much this act changed from my first idea.	
2650	objCommentary	I love it way more this way though.	
2651	objCommentary	This act had a couple big changes right at the end.	
2652	objCommentary	I had a lot of confused ideas about the "message" and how to communicate it.	
2653	objCommentary	One big issue was...	
2654	objCommentary	It didn't make sense to recruit unemployed people to overthrow the factory.	
2655	objCommentary	After all,| everyone in the town complains about it nonstop.	
2656	objCommentary	So wouldn't it make more sense to get people already on the "inside"?	
2657	objCommentary	I thought about changing it so that all the workers were brainwashed...	
2658	objCommentary	As if the factory turned them into robots or something...	
2659	objCommentary	It would have been creepy...| and made the conflict a lot more "obvious."	
2660	objCommentary	But I was committed to keeping everybody's individual personality.	
2661	objCommentary	That's just such a huge part of the Wandersong experience.	
2662	objCommentary	And I didn't want to reduce people to just being "brainwashed"...	
2663	objCommentary	Because in reality,| as I tried to explore here a little bit too,	
2664	objCommentary	Bad things are actually enabled by free-thinking,| well-meaning people!	
2665	objCommentary	So instead I added new dialog for every character,	
2666	objCommentary	Explaining directly why they wouldn't help you overthrow it.	
2667	objCommentary	That really helped to untie an emotional knot in the story.	
2668	objCommentary	I thought a lot about building a "skinner box" into the game via the factory.	
2669	objCommentary	Something totally exploitive,| with all the classic free-to-play app garbage...	
2670	objCommentary	Some friends even made a |(funny)| case to include in-app purchases and profit off it.	
2671	objCommentary	But it was just too evil...|| I couldn't bring myself to do it.	
2672	objCommentary	I guess it's saying something that I could do the violent hero stuff,| but not that.	
2673	objCommentary	What's in the game is meant to evoke that,| but much more toned down.	
2674	objCommentary	It does really tie well with the themes of meaningless happiness...	
2675	objCommentary	We did a lot of things to push the "time" aspect of the gameplay.	
2676	objCommentary	All characters animate very distinctly on the beat...	
2677	objCommentary	And cutscene events like pauses and animation changes are altered to happen on the beat as well.	
2678	objCommentary	We wanted the whole town to feel like clockwork.	
2679	objCommentary	I really really like how the colors out here look during sunset.	
2680	objCommentary	This town ended up taking on kind of a Majora's Mask vibe.	
2681	objCommentary	So it felt very natural to work an astronomer into the plot.	
2682	objCommentary	She ended up being the only "scientific" character in the game...	
2683	objCommentary	I enjoyed her interactions with the bard and the silly magic that rules her universe.	
2684	objCommentary	I really was feeling for Miriam by this part.	
2685	objCommentary	She had ambitions to be the hero of her own story...	
2686	objCommentary	But she ended up being just the hint guide for you.	
2687	objCommentary	I think in a small way,	
2688	objCommentary	She helps the bard contextualize their own loss of not being the hero.	
2689	objCommentary	If we're always looking up,| we erase the people stuck below us.	
2690	objCommentary	I was excited about doing this gameplay for a long time!	
2691	objCommentary	It's probably the most "hardcore" part of the game...	
2692	objCommentary	There were times when I was worried I went too far with it.	
2693	objCommentary	But I think it feels intense and frustrating in a good way.	
2694	objCommentary	It's your first venture into the spirit world after being exlicitly told you don't belong.	
2695	objCommentary	So now the world feels especially ambivalent towards you.	
2696	objCommentary	This spirit world went through the most revisions by far.	
2697	objCommentary	It took |MANY| tries just to tune the clock gameplay...	
2698	objCommentary	Originally I wanted it to be a lot more "squishy"...	
2699	objCommentary	Let the player spin it any speed,| and control the speed of time precisely.	
2700	objCommentary	But that was waaayyy too confusing...	
2701	objCommentary	It took a long time to figure out the visual indications.	
2702	objCommentary	The last big change we made was the world changing color with the direction of time.	
2703	objCommentary	That made it feel a lot more cool!|| It seemed obvious in retrospect.	
2704	objCommentary	Once I gave players control of the speed of time...	
2705	objCommentary	It was really hard to give them a reason to ever make it fast.	
2706	objCommentary	Slower is always easier...	
2707	objCommentary	But if the answer is always to go slower,| you'd never change it.	
2708	objCommentary	And changing it is really cool!	
2709	objCommentary	...|So that's why these things exist.	
2710	objCommentary	I didn't expect anyone to ever get this,	
2711	objCommentary	But the "waiting in line" was inspired by the waterfall puzzle in Earthbound...	
2712	objCommentary	We had so much fun making the song for the "waiting room."	
2713	objCommentary	I was inspired after that to give the Order Fairy their little dances.	
2714	objCommentary	Incidentally,| the song Gord wrote ended up being exactly 69 seconds long.	
2715	objCommentary	That's why the Order Fairy says "nice!" at the end.	
2716	objCommentary	I was figuring out a lot as I went here.	
2717	objCommentary	I didn't know Miriam and the Hero would fight until just as I started writing this scene.	
2718	objCommentary	I was very conflicted about it!	
2719	objCommentary	I felt I was pushing the boundary of what Wandersong was allowed to be.	
2720	objCommentary	I had |SO| many ideas for Queen Order I didn't get to use.	
2721	objCommentary	She was one of the very first characters I sketched for the game.	
2722	objCommentary	She's crazy addicted to tea and has an intense fixation on schedule.	
2723	objCommentary	But the plot had too many other demands at this point.	
2724	objCommentary	The scene at the end here called for every major character to return...	
2725	objCommentary	And we had too much ground to cover.	
2726	objCommentary	Sorry, Queen Order.| Maybe next time...	
2727	objCommentary	The plot of Act 5 was originally my idea for the entire game.	
2728	objCommentary	After I came up with the Earthsong,| it made more sense as a sub-story...	
2729	objCommentary	But that's probably why it ended up so huge.	
2730	objCommentary	There was no getting around it...| the story demanded something epic.	
2731	objCommentary	After dragging myself out of Act 4,| which was full of technical challenges...	
2732	objCommentary	I thought I would try to push through this one quickly.	
2733	objCommentary	I wasn't prepared for it at all,| to be honest.	
2734	objCommentary	I had a lot of creative challenges putting it together.	
2736	objCommentary	I excitedly made this part knowing it was the {wiggle}final ghost battle{/wiggle}	
2737	objCommentary	And I'd already been working on the game long enough...	
2738	objCommentary	...that I felt nostalgic about earlier acts.	
2739	objCommentary	So it starts as a callback to the Act 1 ghosts!	
2740	objCommentary	And then evolves to weird new stuff along a similiar idea.	
2741	objCommentary	It really shows how well trained the player is at singing by now.	
2742	objCommentary	Also,| when I made this bit,| I didn't yet know who Hala was.	
2743	objCommentary	But I did by the time music came in.	
2744	objCommentary	So we skipped ahead and wrote her theme,| then came back snuck it into this part.	
2745	objCommentary	Originally you met the band from Act 2 here.	
2746	objCommentary	They "joined your party" for a bit,| and walked with you...	
2747	objCommentary	They also helped set up some useful background information.	
2748	objCommentary	And in the upcoming music segment,| they were a "marching band" with you.	
2749	objCommentary	Which was how that whole gameplay idea first came about.	
2750	objCommentary	But when I got to the lumber town,| I had no ideas for what was next for them.	
2751	objCommentary	So then I came back and removed them.	
2752	objCommentary	I felt very uncertain about the plot of Act 5 at this point.	
2753	objCommentary	The tone was changing so much from the start of the game,	
2754	objCommentary	I felt I'd lost a clear direction to move on.	
2755	objCommentary	And I was increasingly worried I'd be alienating players.	
2756	objCommentary	In retrospect,| I'm happy with all my choices.	
2757	objCommentary	But at the time I really couldn't see where I was going.	
2758	objCommentary	Things slowly started coming together for the story here.	
2759	objCommentary	This was when I figured out that the other kingdom would be all witches.	
2760	objCommentary	It was a hard decision to make...	
2761	objCommentary	I considered making them a kingdom of monsters too.	
2762	objCommentary	But witches fit into the existing world a lot better.	
2763	objCommentary	And gave me a chance to explore Miriam more...	
2764	objCommentary	It wasn't until MUCH later that I decided to add the Qin animals.	
2765	objCommentary	The people of Rulle needed something "special" on the same level as witches.	
2766	objCommentary	...|It's really embarrassing to admit how hard a time I had with this.	
2767	objCommentary	But it's the true story of how these things came to be.	
2768	objCommentary	It's obvious I was losing a lot of confidence in myself here.	
2769	objCommentary	I'm really glad I didn't give up.	
2770	objCommentary	I kept a notebook for each act in the game.	
2771	objCommentary	I would sketch characters, write plot ideas, note down bugs, etc.	
2772	objCommentary	They're kind of a diary for each part of the game.	
2773	objCommentary	Looking back on act 5,| all I remember is how much I struggled on it.	
2774	objCommentary	But I was surprised to find on the first page of the notebook...	
2775	objCommentary	All the key plot points I'd noted had translated almost 1:1 to the game.	
2776	objCommentary	It was all the details and in-between parts that I'd struggled with!	
2777	objCommentary	This whole city was one of those in-between parts.	
2778	objCommentary	I knew the bard would deliver their message to the king.	
2779	objCommentary	But I had no idea what would happen between arriving here and that.	
2780	objCommentary	The Hero/potion plot came together only bit by bit.	
2781	objCommentary	And even when I had the idea,| I wasn't sure if it was right.	
2782	objCommentary	It was only in the process of writing through it...	
2783	objCommentary	That I found the ways it would connect to Miriam, and future game events.	
2784	objCommentary	I researched Chinese a little bit to name Xiatian.	
2785	objCommentary	This part of the game has a "sun" theme...| and act 5 in general is kind of "sky"...	
2786	objCommentary	So I put together words to make "Xiantian," which means roughly "under the sun."	
2787	objCommentary	I tested it on my roommate Jaymee,| who knows some Chinese (and voiced the Hero...!)	
2788	objCommentary	She told me that what I came up with was basically just the Chinese word for summer.	
2789	objCommentary	So,| go figure.	
2790	objCommentary	I hope it doesn't sound too basic in Chinese to fluent folks.	
2791	objCommentary	I actually first implemented the leaves for this bit.	
2792	objCommentary	Then went back and added them to act 2.	
2793	objCommentary	I'd had them in mind for a long time as a wind-themed toy for act 2...	
2794	objCommentary	And because they were wind-themed,| they should have stayed there.	
2795	objCommentary	I broke my rules by putting them here...	
2796	objCommentary	But when I had the idea for the old lady and the flower,| I was too inspired.	
2797	objCommentary	Allowing myself to break my rules helped me get over my creative block with this act too.	
2798	objCommentary	The theming isn't as strong as a result...	
2799	objCommentary	But in this case the theming was hurting more than helping.	
2800	objCommentary	Does this room look familiar?	
2801	objCommentary	Every Overseer castle starts with a room like this.	
2803	objCommentary	But after the first Overseer dies,| stuff from the spirit world starts sneaking into the real world.	
2804	objCommentary	It happened with the gears/machinery in Act 4 too.	
2805	objCommentary	I wrote the melody and lyrics for the Message to the King.	
2806	objCommentary	I don't know why,| but I was inspired by the original Teen Titans cartoon theme.	
2807	objCommentary	Spell Squad!!!!	
2808	objCommentary	Act 5 was supposed to have kind of a "sun and moon" theme.	
2809	objCommentary	But we had a lot more fun with the "moon" side.	
2810	objCommentary	Hence these cool gals...	
2811	objCommentary	They're like...|| Sailor Moon!|| {shake}GET IT???{/shake}	
2812	objCommentary	I wasn't really excited to do a battle here.	
2813	objCommentary	It felt like a stretch to ask the bard to be in something like this.	
2814	objCommentary	But I also knew that the game wanted to keep venturing in this direction.	
2815	objCommentary	So I had to let it change, slowly.	
2816	objCommentary	Even so...	
2817	objCommentary	I actually made it possible for players to get through this sequence without doing anything.	
2818	objCommentary	So they wouldn't have to participate in the violence.	
2819	objCommentary	Besides "sun and moon"...	
2820	objCommentary	Another theme idea we discussed for act 5 was "smoke and mirrors."	
2821	objCommentary	But we had a lot more fun with mirrors,| in terms of visuals and audio and story.	
2822	objCommentary	Not as much with gameplay...	
2823	objCommentary	We could have done some puzzles with reflected song directions...| or echoes...	
2824	objCommentary	But that also feels too technical for this game.	
2825	objCommentary	The idea for the band you record a song for...	
2826	objCommentary	Had been floating in my mind for a long time.	
2827	objCommentary	It felt like one of those things that we just had to have.	
2828	objCommentary	But when I got this far,| and started to see the path of the rest of the game,	
2829	objCommentary	I realized I was running out of time to use it!	
2830	objCommentary	So it landed here.	
2831	objCommentary	This part also took a lot of visual inspiration from the boat in "Over the Garden Wall."	
2832	objCommentary	Fernando was based on a friend of a friend.	
2833	objCommentary	I was sent an actual YouTube video of him playing accordion on stage...	
2834	objCommentary	And then dunk-shattering it, and lighting it on fire.	
2835	objCommentary	The idea was such a riot!!| So I just took it wholesale.	
2836	objCommentary	Mohabumi!!!	
2837	objCommentary	It means "magic earth" in Hindi.| My friend Divya helped me come up with it.	
2838	objCommentary	It's very fun to say.	
2839	objCommentary	It was Hollow Knight that gave me the idea to try making a Metroidvania here.	
2840	objCommentary	I'd made one before,| and it was some of the most fun I'd had making a game.	
2841	objCommentary	So I was eager to try combining the structure with Wandersong.	
2842	objCommentary	I'm really happy with the result!	
2843	objCommentary	The spell songs were a totally natural fit.	
2844	objCommentary	When I explain Wandersong to gamers,| they often think this is how the whole game works.	
2845	objCommentary	Because it's the only way it's been done in other popular games.	
2846	objCommentary	I enjoyed working up to it over hours and hours of other ideas.	
2847	objCommentary	I gave myself a lot of constraints to keep the design simple.	
2848	objCommentary	Otherwise it would have been too easy to go wild with levels here...	
2849	objCommentary	I liked the idea for 1 "prop" that you learn different ways to manipulate.	
2850	objCommentary	It kept things fairly clean and elegant.	
2851	objCommentary	One of the coolest moments in Metroidvanias is when you get a new ability...	
2852	objCommentary	And it totally transforms the way you see old screens.	
2853	objCommentary	This preserved that "a-ha" feeling without needing to introduce lots of different props.	
2854	objCommentary	It took some trial and error to ensure you couldn't break stuff by using an unexpected song in some places...	
2855	objCommentary	This screen was the reason I implemented dancing.	
2856	objCommentary	At first the bard just had one little move they would do here only.	
2857	objCommentary	But then I started to get big ideas...	
2858	objCommentary	Dancing was just too much fun and too good a fit to keep only here.	
2859	objCommentary	The moment you share with Miriam is what really makes this special,| anyway.	
2860	objCommentary	It took me a long time to work up the courage to write it.	
2861	objCommentary	I think I was partway into Act 6 before I came bAck to fill it in...	
2862	objCommentary	I did most of Miriam's Mohabumi text in one very inspired day.	
2863	objCommentary	Since Act 5 has a lot to do with knowledge & information,	
2864	objCommentary	and truth and lies...	
2865	objCommentary	I did a lot of stuff with "eyes" and obfuscation as well.	
2866	objCommentary	I'm sure nobody noticed,	
2867	objCommentary	But with almost no exception...	
2868	objCommentary	Everyone in Rulle has two visible eyes,	
2869	objCommentary	And everyone in Chaandesh has something obfuscating their eyes,| often glasses.	
2870	objCommentary	To build on that,| I thought about making the Queen blind...	
2871	objCommentary	Maybe a bit on the nose...| but it also tied into the spirit world connection	
2872	objCommentary	(The Moon Overseer never really appears in game,| but they were to be a bat).	
2873	objCommentary	But after some tries I ended up removing that angle.	
2874	objCommentary	It would have been cool to have that representation and conversation...	
2875	objCommentary	But there was too much other stuff going on in the story to give her disability proper framing and time and respect.	
2876	objCommentary	It may as well be canon,| but it never comes up.	
2877	objCommentary	This is probably my favorite song in the game.	
2878	objCommentary	I gave Gord the Ducktales Moon theme and Slow Magic as references.	
2879	objCommentary	And then he went and did something not like either of those things at all...	
2880	objCommentary	But in the long run,| way better than I could have expected.	
2881	objCommentary	We also started having fun using my Omnichord for sound design.	
2882	objCommentary	Try turning down the music a bit and tap dancing here...	
2883	objCommentary	Something deep inside me is crazy about the way lights collide with things in this spirit world.	
2884	objCommentary	I've tried a few times to make a puzzle game using the same concept.	
2885	objCommentary	I dunno,| it just tickles my brain.	
2886	objCommentary	This is probably the part of the game I most often came back to when absentmindedly testing.	
2887	objCommentary	My very early notes for this spirit world talked about "alternate reality bubbles"...	
2888	objCommentary	Trying to find ways to marry "truth and lies" with "light and dark."	
2889	objCommentary	The idea may have been that you activate bubbles to reveal little alternate realities...	
2890	objCommentary	I've seen similiar ideas in other games before.	
2891	objCommentary	But in practice this idea came a lot more easily.	
2892	objCommentary	And it feels very free and floaty,| which I love for this part.	
2893	objCommentary	Ther anxious thinky bits come later.	
2894	objCommentary	Where the last part was open,| and free,| and floaty...	
2895	objCommentary	This part is very very dense, and anxious...	
2896	objCommentary	It feels like the entire screen is nothing but obstruction.	
2897	objCommentary	It's amazing how boring this part would be if you could just see the level.	
2898	objCommentary	As a game designer,| it felt like cheating.	
2899	objCommentary	Designing good stealth is really hard.	
2900	objCommentary	So I kept it very minimal,| and not the only focus.	
2901	objCommentary	Interestingly,	
2902	objCommentary	My friends Matt & Noel put a very similiar section in their game Celeste.	
2903	objCommentary	They happen at similiar points in the story,	
2904	objCommentary	We were working on them at around the same time,	
2905	objCommentary	And we both independently had the idea.	
2906	objCommentary	I think there's something universal-feeling about this gameplay.	
2907	objCommentary	We both were really interested in how changing the game structure changed the feelings of the game...	
2908	objCommentary	And how that worked as a kind of storytelling element.	
2909	objCommentary	I had a hard time getting the chase to feel right.	
2910	objCommentary	For a while it was pretty crappy.	
2911	objCommentary	The stuff it needed basically came down to aesthetic.	
2912	objCommentary	Making the monster feel close...	
2913	objCommentary	Adding lots of static and screenshake...	
2914	objCommentary	The long flat run at the end is kind of a cheat too.	
2915	objCommentary	It all feels much more intense than it "is."	
2916	objCommentary	That's movie magic for you!	
2917	objCommentary	Ending this act was really difficult.	
2918	objCommentary	The stage and conflict were so huge...	
2919	objCommentary	I'd had it in my head that it just had to end with a huge war...	
2920	objCommentary	Or like,| two armies rising against each other,| or something.	
2921	objCommentary	But practically speaking that would be very very hard to depict...	
2922	objCommentary	I'm just one guy!!!!	
2923	objCommentary	Not to mention that once the emotional stakes were raised that high,	
2924	objCommentary	It was that much more daunting to resolve the conflict	
2925	objCommentary	...in a way that felt "fair" and emotionally honest.	
2926	objCommentary	So basically I panicked and procrastinated.	
2927	objCommentary	It was this huge elephant in the room,| hanging over me the entire act.	
2928	objCommentary	And then when I got to this point...	
2929	objCommentary	I was just,| like...| well...	
2930	objCommentary	Maybe I should try just using assets I have already...	
2931	objCommentary	See how it feels...	
2932	objCommentary	And yeah it worked fine.	
2933	objCommentary	If you didn't have ludicrous expectations built up in your head,| like I did.	
2934	objCommentary	I worried over nothing.	
2935	objCommentary	Let that be a lesson to you and I.	
2936	objCommentary	The bard climbs a mountain.	
2937	objCommentary	That's what I wrote on one of the first few pages of notes for this game.	
2938	objCommentary	I was really inspired by the game Journey...	
2939	objCommentary	I wanted to try marrying that game with Wandersong.	
2940	objCommentary	But of course our final result came out very different.	
2941	objCommentary	I spent on time on Google Earth and Wikipedia researching mountains.	
2942	objCommentary	This area was based on "Namche Bazaar,"	
2943	objCommentary	The last little bit of civilization at the foot of Mt. Everest.	
2944	objCommentary	This was the very last screen I finished in the game.	
2945	objCommentary	Not for any good reason.	
2946	objCommentary	I couldn't find any references I liked,| so I skipped over it...	
2947	objCommentary	Then forgot about it until the very end.	
2948	objCommentary	I had climbed some mountains of my own on my bike,	
2949	objCommentary	So I felt I understood the mountain climber "vibe"...	
2950	objCommentary	And my friends were making Celeste at the same time.	
2951	objCommentary	It was interesting to think about our different depictions of "climbing a mountain"...	
2952	objCommentary	I designed these "nets" thinking they'd be a move for the boss at the end of the act.	
2953	objCommentary	They'd trap one of the player characters inside...	
2954	objCommentary	And you'd have to free them!	
2955	objCommentary	I also tried using the birds as an element in that battle too,	
2956	objCommentary	As a way to get around.	
2957	objCommentary	But none of that worked or mixed together at all.	
2958	objCommentary	Initially I animated the birds frame by frame,| as I do most characters.	
2959	objCommentary	But for non-human characters,| the choppy animation style of this game really sucks the life out.	
2960	objCommentary	Or I lack the skill to make it work.	
2961	objCommentary	So I ended up re-making the birds with a sort of advanced "skeleton" of pieces that move with code.	
2962	objCommentary	That way their movements are smooth and lifelike.	
2963	objCommentary	They're using the same "skeleton" system I designed for the intermission bird boss.	
2964	objCommentary	Which then got used for other big creatures,| like the end of act 6&7 bosses.	
2965	objCommentary	But for some cases it was too intensive to render the skeleon animations.	
2966	objCommentary	So they switch to the old frames...	
2967	objCommentary	The appearance is noticably different is you look closely.	
2968	objCommentary	You can see the frames inside this bubble, but they become "advanced" after it breaks.	
2969	objCommentary	I added the bard's text to the troll way after the fact.	
2970	objCommentary	I wanted most of Act 6 to pass by without text...	
2971	objCommentary	To really emphasize "universal language," communicating with animals.	
2972	objCommentary	But EVERYONE thought this was the troll from act 2.	
2973	objCommentary	And I felt it was important to clarify, so players' feelings weren't hurt.	
2974	objCommentary	Now it kinda serves as a "transition" moment from speech to pantomime.	
2975	objCommentary	Act 6 is kind of about the sequence of "partners" you have.	
2976	objCommentary	Judging from my sketches,| I had a lot of ideas for big strong animals...	
2977	objCommentary	But once I thought of the bugs,| there was no turning back.	
2978	objCommentary	I'd go so far as to say their story is one of the most important in the game.	
2979	objCommentary	So...| This bit does go a bit long,| but I wanted it to be as annoying as possible.	
2980	objCommentary	I wanted some people to get exasperated with the bard,| like...	
2981	objCommentary	{shake}"Just step on them!!! Sheesh!"	
2982	objCommentary	This bit was very cathartic for me to make.	
2983	objCommentary	Because...	
2984	objCommentary	I'm actually terrified of bugs.	
2985	objCommentary	I challenged myself to use that and feel it while making this part.	
2986	objCommentary	Like...| making them really creepy-crawly...	
2987	objCommentary	But also somehow cute...| and friendly!	
2988	objCommentary	In the end,| this game wants to promote the idea of universal love.	
2989	objCommentary	So if players could learn to love something creepy and gross,	
2990	objCommentary	Like I did...	
2991	objCommentary	Then that's a job well done.	
2992	objCommentary	In the game "Night in the Woods"...	
2993	objCommentary	There's a happy little computer shark character named Sharkle.	
2994	objCommentary	And I did his happy little voice.	
2995	objCommentary	Em really wanted to bring a similiar dopey character to the sky seals.	
2996	objCommentary	So the voice I did for them kind of evokes that...	
2997	objCommentary	This screen is very inspired by Celeste.	
2998	objCommentary	Chapter 4,| the windy one,| is my favorite one visually.	
2999	objCommentary	And I love the epic feeling of walking through the wind.	
3000	objCommentary	It's a bit like the end of Journey too.	
3001	objCommentary	We didn't do it nearly as well,| but there it is.	
3002	objCommentary	This scene was a huge one I envisioned from early on.	
3003	objCommentary	The game just had to have a moment like this,| didn't it?	
3004	objCommentary	Once I sat down to actually write it...| I was surprised to find Audrey quite tough.	
3005	objCommentary	Even in the face of death,| she has a really hard time opening up.	
3006	objCommentary	I think she has a lot of motivating factors that she'd never bring up.	
3007	objCommentary	This was my last chance to be silly for the whole game.	
3008	objCommentary	So I really soaked it in.	
3009	objCommentary	Like warming up by a fire before rushing off into a snowstorm.	
3010	objCommentary	I think the Heart Fairy is just so great.	
3011	objCommentary	I talked Gord into making the song with dog barks.	
3012	objCommentary	And we even worked her melody into the boss song.	
3013	objCommentary	This boss was pretty atrociously bad for a while.	
3014	objCommentary	I had a million ideas for it and threw them all together and they did not mix.	
3015	objCommentary	There was a much more complicated layout with lots of platforms the wolf jumped between.	
3016	objCommentary	And Audrey would pathfind around and try to shoot him...| it was a mess.	
3017	objCommentary	And every element had different "gameplay."	
3018	objCommentary	You had to match notes with Audrey to charge her sword,	
3019	objCommentary	Guide the direction of a bird to fly around the battlefield,	
3020	objCommentary	And sing to break open bubbles the wolf would trap you and Audrey in...	
3021	objCommentary	It sounds really "epic!" but wow it was so so bad.	
3022	objCommentary	I ended up giving up and moving on.	
3023	objCommentary	After designing Act 7,| I felt I had a better understanding of how to make the boss work.	
3024	objCommentary	So I came back and started from scratch,| with the "shield" concept.	
3025	objCommentary	Narrowing it to one "verb" made it feel a LOT cooler.	
3026	objCommentary	Which might be counter-intuitive,| but it's true.	
3027	objCommentary	I also felt it important to angle the bard as a "protector" in this fight.	
3028	objCommentary	To differentiate them from Audrey, who is the attacker.	
3029	objCommentary	Having the player character as an emphatically "supporting" role in the game conflict...	
3030	objCommentary	Well,| it felt just right for Wandersong.	
3031	objCommentary	For this screen,| I took the very first screen in the game...	
3032	objCommentary	And flipped it.| Whoa!!!	
3033	objCommentary	I like thinking about how different directions of progression feel in a side-scroller like this.	
3034	objCommentary	Because of the classics,| going right feels "right."	
3035	objCommentary	So sending the player "left" has a different feeling to it,| which I really enjoy.	
3036	objCommentary	I don't know about you...	
3037	objCommentary	But for me,| going back to these old levels and apocalypse-ing them was pretty...	
3038	objCommentary	Whoah.	
3039	objCommentary	The falling stars in the background were another fun touch from Act 1.	
3040	objCommentary	You see stars falling like that all the time in the spirit world.	
3041	objCommentary	But now,| they're in the "real world"...	
3042	objCommentary	And they're not just a pretty background...!| They actually hit the ground and explode!	
3043	objCommentary	It's all getting a bit too real,| hmm?	
3044	objCommentary	This screen was directly inspired by my favorite bit of Celeste.	
3045	objCommentary	The dream before chapter 6,| where you fly up with feathers...	
3046	objCommentary	I worked closely with Gord to make a song that built up as you climbed.	
3047	objCommentary	I knew from early on that I wanted the Dream King to be the "final boss."	
3048	objCommentary	But the form that fight took changed many times in my head.	
3050	objCommentary	I thought the final encounter might be the bard pleading alone against the Dream King,	
3051	objCommentary	Using the power of song to convince him back to the light.	
3052	objCommentary	But the story grew many layers by the time I got here...	
3053	objCommentary	And Audrey stole the show as the obvious antagonist.	
3054	objCommentary	Still,| I enjoy thinking about the fight from that perspective.	
3055	objCommentary	If this is really Audrey's game,| then the Dream King really IS the final boss.	
3056	objCommentary	And your mission in the end is to help the final boss win.	
3057	objCommentary	My early ideas for the battle suffered the same as my first try on the Act 6 boss.	
3058	objCommentary	Every attack was a different game mechanic,	
3059	objCommentary	Nothing overlapped,| and the result was a mess.	
3061	objCommentary	Because the battle represents such a pivotal moment in the story...	
3062	objCommentary	It was tempting to throw every idea at it to make it "epic".	
3063	objCommentary	But I quickly realized it was more important to make it feel good.	
3064	objCommentary	The falling stars were the coolest-feeling attack,| so I honed in on those.	
3065	objCommentary	I tried extending the idea with the plants.	
3066	objCommentary	They follow your singing in a similar way, but you have to aim them differently.	
3067	objCommentary	And only after several playtests did I have the idea for Audrey hitting back stars.	
3068	objCommentary	I wanted her to feel surprising and alive and adaptive,| like a human player.	
3069	objCommentary	This concept for an "end of the world" came 100% from Em.	
3070	objCommentary	After playing with music and color for the whole game it seemed like a very apt idea.	
3071	objCommentary	After every Overseer death we desaturated the colors and removed sounds to foreshadow this...	
3072	objCommentary	Silence was always our symbol for "The End"	
3073	objCommentary	This is what it all builds up to.	
3074	objCommentary	We had many discussions throughout development on how to execute this.	
3075	objCommentary	The core concept was always the same...	
3076	objCommentary	The bard starts singing alone,| and one by one characters join in from across the game.	
3077	objCommentary	For a long time we thought it would become the "real" Earthsong when everyone came together.	
3078	objCommentary	And at that point,| it would "evolve" into just noise and sounds...	
3079	objCommentary	Because it was too "pure" to grasp the true form of,| like the face of god.	
3080	objCommentary	But it felt a little more achievable when I decided it wouldn't "actually" "be" the Earthsong.	
3081	objCommentary	It's just a good try at it.	
3082	objCommentary	That way we could be comfortable rendering something "accurate."	
3083	objCommentary	And I find the message at the end way stronger as well.	
3084	objCommentary	As far as the specific gameplay,	
3085	objCommentary	I had no idea what it would be until we got this far.	
3086	objCommentary	(I'm sure that's no surprise if you've been reading these up to now).	
3087	objCommentary	The idea to use the end of act instruments was very obvious,| in retrospect.	
3088	objCommentary	But at the time it was a huge epiphany.	
3089	objCommentary	It was also good because I didn't have to think of much new stuff.	
3090	objCommentary	I got to focus on refining the gameplay and making it feel nice,	
3091	objCommentary	Without the pressure of coming up with new ideas.	
3092	objCommentary	And all my work here also improved the instrument sections in previous acts.	
3093	objCommentary	The commentary itself was a very last moment decision.	
3094	objCommentary	I had the idea and we wrote it all in the last couple weeks of the project.	
3095	objCommentary	It felt a bit self-centered to fill the game with my voice like this...	
3096	objCommentary	But I also very fondly remember digging into commentary by other artists I love.	
3097	objCommentary	And I wanted to use the opportunity to clue people into the process a bit.	
3098	objCommentary	We tried to make the path for unlocking it very obtuse,	
3099	objCommentary	So that players would generally have to look it up to find it.	
3100	objCommentary	That way,| they had already mentally "left" the world of the game,	
3101	objCommentary	So we could do something meta without breaking the experience for players who enjoy the illusion.	
3102	objCommentary	Commentary on our design decision to put commentary into the game...	
3103	objCommentary	We're probably at about peak meta,| aren't we?	
3104	objCommentary	Fitting for the "final" commentary in the game.	
3105	objCommentary	Thanks for playing!
